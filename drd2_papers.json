Aripiprazole, a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist, reduces prolactin elevation induced by antipsychotic drugs used for schizophrenia treatment. The molecular targets and mechanisms underlying the contrasting effects of these two drugs on prolactin regulation are unclear. The objective of this study was to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms of prolactin regulation by aripiprazole and amisulpride using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. METHODS: Relevant targets of amisulpride and aripiprazole and for schizophrenia and elevated prolactin treatment were obtained from online databases and screened for significance. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of the core targets were performed to identify key biological processes and signaling pathways, and a target-pathway-drug integrated network was established. The binding affinities of amisulpride and aripiprazole with core targets were predicted using molecular docking analyses. RESULTS: Screening and matching drug and disease targets combined with GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed several key signaling pathways involved in prolactin regulation, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and dopamine receptor pathways. The core targets of aripiprazole include MAPK3, PPARG, DRD2, and ESR1, and amisulpride primarily targets MMP9, CDC42, mTOR, and AKT1. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that aripiprazole and amisulpride have high binding affinities for their respective targets, supporting the hypothesis that these drugs regulate prolactin levels through target-ligand interactions. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the distinct signaling pathways and molecular networks involved in prolactin regulation by aripiprazole and amisulpride and provide new insights into the mechanisms of these drugs in schizophrenia treatment. Further pharmacological and clinical research is needed to validate the complex regulatory networks and in vivo effects.", "first_author": "Yao, Kaifang", "date_published": "2025 April 14"}, {"pmid": "40179998", "title": "Transcriptomic analysis and experiment to verify the mechanism of Xiaoyao san in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with depression.", "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaoyao san (XYS) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine compound first recorded in \"Taiping Huimin Heji Ju Fang\". Traditionally, it is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression. However, its mechanism of action in treating IBS patients with depressive symptoms is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects of XYS on intestinal and depressive symptoms in IBS and explore the mechanisms through transcriptomic analysis and pharmacological experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IBS was induced in mice through a combination of chronic unpredictable mild stress and intragastric senna leaf stimulation. We evaluated six depressive parameters, examined colon tissue with hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy, analyzed related proteins using western blotting, and performed transcriptomics on brain and intestinal tissues. The possible mechanism of action was speculated by network analysis of transcriptome results and further verified using the IBS model. RESULTS: The results show that XYS restored mouse weight, reduced intestinal symptoms and sensitivity, suppressed villous loss and atrophy, and enhanced the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Notably, XYS decreased the depression-like behavior. Transcriptomic analysis combined with pharmacological experiments revealed that XYS inhibited the expression of proteins related to the intestinal ACT1/TRAF6/P38MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway while activating the brain's DRD2/TH signaling pathway and increasing dopamine release in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: XYS may regulate the brain-gut axis function and improve intestinal and depressive symptoms in IBS model mice through the intestinal ACT1/TRAF6/P38MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway and the brain DRD2/TH signaling pathway.", "first_author": "Yu, Jiaoyan", "date_published": "2025 May 12"}, {"pmid": "40128405", "title": "The dopamine receptor agonist rotigotine attenuated indomethacin-induced enteropathy in the small intestinal mucosa of mice.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced enteropathy is characterized by disruption of the epithelial barrier and immune homeostasis, resulting in symptoms such as congestion, ulcers and inflammation. Research has suggested that dopamine (DA) exerts a protective effect on the gastroduodenal and colonic mucosa. The present study aimed to explore the effect of DA on NSAID-induced injury to the small intestinal mucosa. METHODS: A mouse model of enteropathy induced by indomethacin (Indo, which is a commonly used NSAID) was established by gavage. The DA agonist rotigotine (Roti) was administered alone or in combination with the DA receptor 2 (DRD2) antagonist domperidone (Domp) to model mice to determine the effect of Roti and the key role of DRD2 in this effect. Bilateral vagotomy was performed to determine whether the effect of Roti was mediated by the brain\u2012gut axis. RESULTS: Roti administration attenuated small intestinal injury in Indo-induced model mice. However, Domp administration alone exacerbated this injury. Moreover, Roti mitigated small intestinal injury by increasing Occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression and decreasing TNF-alpha and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression. However, the effects of Roti were abrogated by Domp. In contrast to Domp, vagotomy before Indo administration did not alter the enteroprotective effects of Roti. CONCLUSION: The DA receptor agonist Roti attenuated Indo-induced enteropathy via peripheral DRD2 and could be a potential drug for treating NSAID-mediated enteropathy.", "first_author": "Su, Tian", "date_published": "2025 March 24"}, {"pmid": "40073616", "title": "Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) TaqIA gene polymorphism and acute risperidone-induced changes in body weight, plasma glucose and lipid profile.", "abstract": "There are indications that the transient blockade of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone is related to their metabolic side effects.

Through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and drug-likeness screening, we identified 38 active compounds. Network pharmacology studies revealed that these 38 compounds might affect 103 targets associated with insomnia, such as monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), interleukin 1beta (IL1B), solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), which contribute to regulating the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, 5-hydroxytryptaminergic synapse, and calcium signaling pathways. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations indicated that bis[(6,6-dimethyl-3-bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-enyl)methyl] (E)-but-2-enedioate exhibited a stabilizing interaction with MAOB. The animal studies demonstrated that gavage administration of a high dose (100 mg/kg) of VVO significantly diminished autonomous activity, decreased sleep latency, and extended sleep duration in mice. Furthermore, the results of the Western blot experiment indicated that VVO interacts with MAOB, resulting in decreased expression levels of MAOB in the cerebral cortex.

While extensive research has been conducted in the last few decades, only a few drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment, and even fewer aim to be curative rather than manage symptoms. There remains an urgent need for understanding disease pathogenesis, as well as identifying new targets for further drug discovery. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to stem from a build-up of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques as well as tangles of tau proteins. Furthermore, inflammation in the brain is known to arise from the degeneration of tissue and the build-up of insoluble material. Therefore, there is a potential link between the pathology of AD and inflammation in the brain, especially as the disease progresses to later stages where neuronal death and degeneration levels are higher. Proteins that are relevant to both brain inflammation and AD thus make ideal potential targets for therapeutics; however, the proteins need to be evaluated to determine which targets would be ideal for potential drug therapeutic treatments, or 'druggable'. Druggability analysis was conducted using two structure-based methods (i.e., Drug-Like Density analysis and SiteMap), as well as a sequence-based approach, SPIDER. The most druggable targets were then evaluated using single-nuclei sequencing data for their clinical relevance to inflammation in AD. For each of the top five targets, small molecule docking was used to evaluate which FDA approved drugs were able to bind with the chosen proteins. The top targets included DRD2 (inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity), C9 (binds with C5B8 to form the membrane attack complex), C4b (binds with C2a to form C3 convertase), C5AR1 (GPCR that binds C5a), and GABA-A-R (GPCR involved in inhibiting neurotransmission). Each target had multiple potential inhibitors from the FDA-approved drug list with decent binding infinities. Among these inhibitors, two drugs were found as top inhibitors for more than one protein target. They are C15H14N2O2 and v316 (Paracetamol), used to treat pain/inflammation originally for cataracts and relieve headaches/fever, respectively.

MDPV is a beta-cathinone derivative endowed with psychostimulant activity. Similarly to recreational substances, consumption of palatable food stimulates the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, resulting in neuroadaptive changes. METHODS: Adolescent C57BL/6N mice were fed either control diet (CD), 10% of kcal from fat, or high-fat diet (HFD), 60% of kcal from fat. After eight weeks, one group of HFD-fed mice had their diet changed to CD for an additional two weeks. Fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance were measured to detect impairment in glucose metabolism. Subsequently, the mice were treated with either MDPV (1 mg/kg) or saline, and their locomotor activity was measured. Using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the expression of dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1), dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2), and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene B (FosB) genes was measured in the striatum of mice. RESULTS: Feeding with HFD caused obesity and glucose intolerance in mice. Restriction of fat reduced body mass and reversed impairment of glucose metabolism. HFD-fed mice responded to MDPV with higher potency than CD-fed counterparts, with an increased incidence of stereotypies. A change of diet partially reversed this effect. Downregulation of Drd2 was observed in the mice that switched from HFD to CD, whereas treatment with MDPV caused upregulation of FosB only in the CD-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Current results suggest that obesity may increase sensitivity to psychostimulant effects of MDPV and elevate the risk of addiction as mice fed with HFD responded to acute treatment with MDPV with higher potency and showed tolerance of FosB induction in response to the drug.", "first_author": "Wojcieszak, Jakub", "date_published": "2025 April"}, {"pmid": "39854822", "title": "Paediatric strategy forum for medicinal product development in diffuse midline gliomas in children and adolescents ACCELERATE in collaboration with the European Medicines Agency with participation of the Food and Drug Administration.", "abstract": "Fewer than 10 % of children with diffuse midline glioma (DMG) survive 2 years from diagnosis.

METHODS: Utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking, we identified the top ten medicinal herbs with anxiolytic and antidepressant potential. Herbs with cytoprotective effects and non-toxic characteristics were further screened to formulate the herbal blends. Subsequently, we established a PC12 cell injury model and a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in mice to assess the effects of our formulations. RESULTS: Ten medicinal herbs were initially screened, and six of them were deemed suitable for formulating the blend, namely Gancao, Dazao, Gouqizi, Sangye, Huangqi, and Jinyinhua (GDGSHJ). The GDGSHJ formulation reduced Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, decreased apoptosis, and demonstrated a favorable antidepressant and antianxiety effect in the CUMS mouse model. Besides, GDGSHJ led to the upregulation of serum 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) content and brain tissue 5-HT, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Dopamine (DA) levels. It also downregulated the expression of SLC6A4 and SLC6A3 genes in the mouse hippocampus while upregulating HTR1A, DRD1, DRD2, and GABRA1 genes. CONCLUSION: Our formulation exhibited robust antidepressant and antianxiety effects without inducing substantial toxicity. This efficacy appears to be mediated by the expression of relevant genes within the hippocampus of mice. The formulation achieved this effect by balancing 5-HT levels in the serum and DA, GABA, and 5-HT levels within brain tissue.", "first_author": "Luo, Ting", "date_published": "2024 November"}, {"pmid": "39187246", "title": "Association Study Between DRD2, DRD3 Genetic Polymorphisms and Adverse Reactions in Chinese Patients on Amisulpride Treatment.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if the cardiac function and \"endocrinium\" of Chinese patients are associated with dopamine D(2) (DRD2) (rs6276) and DRD3 (rs6280, rs963468) genetic polymorphisms when treated with amisulpride.

DRD2 (rs6276) and DRD3 (rs6280, rs963468) genetic polymorphisms were detected with TaqMan-MGB allelic discrimination. RESULTS: Analysis by multivariate covariance analysis (MANCOVA) showed that after adjusting for age, gender, and the baseline level, the increase in the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) in the rs6276 AG group was higher than that in the AA and GG groups. Similarly, the changed estradiol (E(2)) level in rs6276 GG and rs963468 GG groups was higher than that in the other two groups. Adjusting for covariates, the increased triglyceride (TG) level in rs6276 GG and rs963468 GG groups was the highest among their different genotype groups. The increase in the level of \"AST\" in the rs6280 TT group was higher than that in the CC and CT groups upon adjusting for covariates.

The successful discovery of numerous effective DRD2 inhibitors has led to their clinical application and ongoing evaluation in various clinical trials. This review explores the synthetic approaches and clinical applications of prototypical small-molecule DRD2 inhibitors that have received approval or are currently undergoing clinical trials, highlighting their therapeutic potential and challenges. The synthesis of these inhibitors employs various chemical strategies, including modifications of phenothiazine and butyrophenone structures, which have yielded significant antipsychotic agents like chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Additionally, newer classes of inhibitors, such as aripiprazole, exhibit partial agonist activity at DRD2, offering a unique therapeutic profile. Clinically, DRD2 inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in managing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, manic episodes in bipolar disorder, and dopaminergic imbalance in Parkinson's disease. However, the emergence of adverse effects, including tardive dyskinesia, extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic syndrome, presents substantial challenges. Advances in the development of second-generation antipsychotics aim to balance efficacy with a better side effect profile by targeting additional neurotransmitter receptors.

METHODS: One-month-old C57BL/6J male and female mice were subjected to either a control diet or an HFD for 5 and 9 months. Muscle strength, motor skills, sensorimotor integration, and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed at the end of the 5th and 8th months. Key dopaminergic molecules, including dopamine (DA), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), dopamine transporter (DAT), and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), were quantified at the end of the 5th or 9th months. RESULTS: Behaviorally, male mice exposed to HFD exhibited more pronounced alterations in sensorimotor integration, anxiety-like behavior, and muscle strength after the 5th month of dietary exposure. In contrast, female mice displayed most behavioral differences after the 8th month of HFD exposure. Physiologically, there were notable sex-specific variations in the dopaminergic pathway response to HFD. Male mice exposed to HFD exhibited elevated tissue levels of VMAT2 and DRD2, whereas female mice showed reduced levels of DRD2 and DAT compared to control groups.

Therefore, this study undertook a novel pharmacogenomics-based in silico investigation of FDA-approved opioid medications. The DrugBank database was employed to identify all FDA-approved opioids. Subsequently, the PharmGKB database was utilized to filter through all variant annotations associated with the relevant genes. In addition, the dpSNP ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ), a publicly accessible repository, was used. Additional analyses were conducted using STRING-MODEL (version 12), Cytoscape (version 3.10.1), miRTargetLink.2, and NetworkAnalyst (version 3). The study identified 125 target genes of FDA-approved opioids, encompassing 7019 variant annotations. Of these, 3088 annotations were significant and pertained to 78 genes. During variant annotation assessments (VAA), 672 variants remained after filtration. Further in-depth filtration based on variant functions yielded 302 final filtered variants across 56 genes. The Monoamine GPCRs pathway emerged as the most significant signaling pathway. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed a fully connected network comprising 55 genes. Gene-miRNA Interaction (GMI) analysis of these 55 candidate genes identified miR-16-5p as a pivotal miRNA in this network. Protein-Drug Interaction (PDI) assessment showed that multiple drugs, including Ibuprofen, Nicotine, Tramadol, Haloperidol, Ketamine, L-Glutamic Acid, Caffeine, Citalopram, and Naloxone, had more than one interaction. Furthermore, Protein-Chemical Interaction (PCI) analysis highlighted that ABCB1, BCL2, CYP1A2, KCNH2, PTGS2, and DRD2 were key targets of the proposed chemicals.

METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups comprising of vehicle-treated control, NS oil only, Smoke only, Smoke + NS oil, Nicotine only and Nicotine + NS oil. Animals were passively exposed to cigarette smoke or nicotine vapour for 12 weeks, however, NS oil treatment commenced from 9th-12th week of the experimental duration. RESULTS: Nicotine vapour and cigarette smoke-induced increase in cotinine level were significantly ameliorated by NS treatment. Cigarette smoke or nicotine vapour exposure significantly (p<0.05) decreased the level of antioxidant enzymes while increasing malondialdehyde level in the brain homogenates of the rats. Administration of NS oil significantly (p<0.05) reversed the reduced antioxidant level. Cigarette-smoke also significantly increased alpha4-nAChR expression in the frontal cortex and olfactory bulb compared to control. Nicotine vapour significantly increased DRD2 expression only in the olfactory cortex.

However, the mechanism of action of quetiapine is unclear. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to determine the molecular mechanisms of quetiapine bidirectional regulation of bipolar depression and mania. METHODS: Putative target genes for quetiapine were collected from the GeneCard, SwissTargetPrediction, and DrugBank databases. Targets for bipolar depression and bipolar mania were identified from the DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated using the String database and imported into Cytoscape. DAVID and the Bioinformatics platform were employed to perform the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the top 15 core targets. The drug-pathway-target-disease network was constructed using Cytoscape. Finally, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interactions between quetiapine and potential targets. RESULTS: Targets for quetiapine actions against bipolar depression (126 targets) and bipolar mania (81 targets) were identified. Based on PPI and KEGG pathway analyses, quetiapine may affect bipolar depression by targeting the MAPK and PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathways via BDNF, INS, EGFR, IGF1, and NGF, and it may affect bipolar mania by targeting the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway via HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, DRD2, and GRIN2B. Molecular docking revealed good binding affinity between quetiapine and potential targets. LIMITATIONS: Pharmacological experiments should be conducted to verify and further explore these results.

The Axiom PharmacoFocus Array technique was employed to generate accurate star allele-predicted phenotypes of 3 PK genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6). Genotype calls for 5 candidate PD receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2C, and HTR2A) were obtained and reported as wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous for 11 variants.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted for nongenetic factors, suggested nonsignificant impacts of the star allele-predicted phenotypes of all 3 PK genes on improvement in ASD symptoms or CGI scores.

Given research showing that glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may have an antidepressant effect, we sought to evaluate the impact of exogenous GDNF on depression-like behaviour in mouse models of Parkinson disease. METHODS: We used an established subacute model of Parkinson disease in mice involving intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), followed by brain stereotaxic injection of GDNF into the mPFC region. Subsequently, we assessed depression-like behaviour using the sucrose preference test, forced swimming test and tail suspension test, while also evaluating protein expression in the mPFC. RESULTS: We included 60 mice, divided into 3 groups, including a control group (saline injection), an MPTP plus saline injection group and an MPTP plus GDNF injection group. We found that exogenous GDNF injection into the mPFC led to an increase in dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) protein levels. We also observed that activating the protein kinase A pathway through DRD1 produced a prolonged antidepressant response. Under GDNF stimulation, the expression of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) remained constant, suggesting that the DRD2 signal was ineffective in alleviating depression-like symptoms. Moreover, our investigation involved Golgi staining and Western blot techniques, which found enhanced synaptic plasticity, including increased dendritic branches, dendritic spines and retrograde protection after GDNF treatment in Parkinson disease models. LIMITATIONS: A subtle motor phenotype became evident only toward the conclusion of the behavioural testing period. The study exclusively involved male mice, and no separate control group receiving only GDNF treatment was included in the experimental design. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a positive effect of exogenous GDNF on synaptic plasticity, mediated by DRD1 signalling in the mPFC, which could facilitate depression remission in Parkinson disease.", "first_author": "Liu, Yehao", "date_published": "2024 January-February"}, {"pmid": "38286627", "title": "Enhancement of Haloperidol-Induced Catalepsy by GPR143, an L-Dopa Receptor, in Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons.", "abstract": "Dopamine neurons play crucial roles in pleasure, reward, memory, learning, and fine motor skills and their dysfunction is associated with various neuropsychiatric diseases. Dopamine receptors are the main target of treatment for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Antipsychotics that antagonize the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) are used to alleviate the symptoms of these disorders but may also sometimes cause disabling side effects such as parkinsonism (catalepsy in rodents). Here we show that GPR143, a G-protein-coupled receptor for L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), expressed in striatal cholinergic interneurons enhances the DRD2-mediated side effects of haloperidol, an antipsychotic agent. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was attenuated in male Gpr143 gene-deficient (Gpr143(-/y) ) mice compared with wild-type (Wt) mice. Reducing the endogenous release of L-DOPA and preventing interactions between GPR143 and DRD2 suppressed the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in Wt mice but not Gpr143(-/y) mice. The phenotypic defect in Gpr143(-/y) mice was mimicked in cholinergic interneuron-specific Gpr143(-/y) (Chat-cre;Gpr143(flox/y) ) mice.

In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing DRD2, co-expression of GPR143 increased cell surface expression level of DRD2, and L-DOPA application further enhanced the DRD2 surface expression. Shorter pauses in cholinergic interneuron firing activity were observed after intrastriatal stimulation in striatal slice preparations from Chat-cre;Gpr143(flox/y) mice compared with those from Wt mice.

This article aims at better characterizing ALS patients who could possibly benefit from rasagiline by reporting new subgroup analysis and genetic data. METHODS: We performed further exploratory in-depth analyses of the study population and investigated the relevance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the dopaminergic system. RESULTS: Placebo-treated patients with very slow disease progression (loss of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised [ALSFRS-R] per month before randomization of </=0.328 points) showed a per se survival probability after 24 months of 0.85 (95% confidence interval = 0.65-0.94). The large group of intermediate to fast progressing ALS patients showed a prolonged survival in the rasagiline group compared to placebo after 6 and 12 months (p = 0.02, p = 0.04), and a reduced decline of ALSFRS-R after 18 months (p = 0.049).

In this study, Quercetin nanocrystals (QNC) were synthesized and compared to standard QUE. A network-pharmacology-based methodology was applied, including target prediction, network construction, a gene ontology (GO) analysis, a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and molecular docking. This study aimed to identify the targets of QUE relevant to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and investigate the associated pharmacological mechanisms. Most of the predicted targets are involved in dopamine uptake during synaptic transmission. QUE regulates the key targets DRD2 and DRD4, which significantly affect dopaminergic synapses. The molecular docking results showed that QUE had a better binding affinity than the standard drug l-Dopa.

Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently discovered and cross-validated genome-wide significant (GWS) loci for suicide attempt (SA). The present study leveraged the genetic cohorts from both studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of SA to date. Multi-ancestry and admixture-specific meta-analyses were conducted within groups of significant African, East Asian, and European ancestry admixtures. METHODS: This study comprised 22 cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,025 ancestry-matched controls. Analytical methods across multi-ancestry and individual ancestry admixtures included inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses, followed by gene, gene-set, tissue-set, and drug-target enrichment, as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization with brain expression quantitative trait loci data, phenome-wide genetic correlation, and genetic causal proportion analyses. RESULTS: Multi-ancestry and European ancestry admixture GWAS meta-analyses identified 12 risk loci at p values <5x10(-8). These loci were mostly intergenic and implicated DRD2, SLC6A9, FURIN, NLGN1, SOX5, PDE4B, and CACNG2. The multi-ancestry SNP-based heritability estimate of SA was 5.7% on the liability scale (SE=0.003, p=5.7x10(-80)). Significant brain tissue gene expression and drug set enrichment were observed. There was shared genetic variation of SA with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, smoking, and risk tolerance after conditioning SA on both major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Genetic causal proportion analyses implicated shared genetic risk for specific health factors.

Human GBM cells and intracranial GBM model were used to assess the effects of chronic stress on GBM growth. Targeted neurotransmitter sequencing, RNA-seq, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the related molecular mechanism. RESULTS: Chronic stress promoted GBM progression and up-regulated the level of dopamine (DA) and its receptor type 2 (DRD2) in tumor tissues. Down-regulation or inhibition of DRD2 abolished the promoting effect of chronic stress on GBM progression. Mechanistically, the elevated DA and DRD2 activated ERK1/2 and consequently inhibited GSK3beta activity, leading to beta-catenin activation. Meanwhile, the activated ERK1/2 up-regulated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) level in GBM cells and then promoted DA secretion, forming an autocrine positive feedback loop. Remarkably, patients with high-depression exhibited high DRD2 and beta-catenin levels, which showed poor prognosis. Additionally, DRD2 specific inhibitor pimozide combined with temozolomide synergistically inhibited GBM growth.

A model of PD induced by MPTP was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of EZW in mice. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms of EZW for the prevention and treatment of PD were then explored using a combination of multilevel databases, network pharmacology, biological experiments, and LCMS/MS. In vivo data showed that pretreatment with EZW can be neuroprotective against MPTP-induced motor dysfunction and can effectively rescue dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced degeneration in mice. Furthermore, data from combined multilevel databases and network pharmacology analysis strategies suggested that the neuroprotective activity of EZW in the treatment of PD is mediated by a complicated multicomponent, multitarget network. Genes such as Grm2, Grm5, Drd2, and Grik2 were identified as important therapeutic targets. Subsequent experimental validation showed that EZW can broadly regulate the mRNA levels of these receptor genes as well as BDNF, and consequently increase the phosphorylation levels of CREB to stimulate CREB signaling. These targets and signaling systems may be responsible for the reversal of neuronal death by EZW after MPTP exposure.

The combination of temozolomide with another agent could offer an improved treatment option if it could overcome chemoresistance and prevent side effects. Here, we determined the critical drug that cause ferroptosis in GBM cells and elucidated the possible mechanism by which drug combination overcomes chemoresistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Haloperidol/temozolomide synergism was assessed in GBM cell lines with different dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) expression in vitro and in vivo. Inhibitors of ferroptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) were used to validate the specific mechanisms by which haloperidol and temozolomide induce ferroptosis in GBM cells. RESULTS: In the present work, we demonstrate that the DRD2 level is increased by temozolomide in a time-dependent manner and is inversely correlated with temozolomide sensitivity in GBM. The DRD2 antagonist haloperidol, a butylbenzene antipsychotic, markedly induces ferroptosis and effectively enhances temozolomide efficacy in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, haloperidol suppressed the effect of temozolomide on cAMP by antagonizing DRD2 receptor activity, and the increases in cAMP/PKA triggered ER stress, which led to autophagy and ferroptosis. Furthermore, elevated autophagy mediates downregulation of FTH1 expression at the posttranslational level in an autophagy-dependent manner and ultimately leads to ferroptosis.

The clinical risk factors guiding the prophylactic treatment are well established, but genetic factors associated with PONV remain poorly known. The aim of this study was to explore clinical and genetic factors impacting PONV by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) together with relevant clinical factors as covariates, and systematically attempt to replicate previously reported PONV associations. Relevant clinical factors are explored with logistic regression model. METHODS: This was an observational case control study in Helsinki University Hospital between 1 August 2006 and 31 December 2010. One thousand consenting women with elevated risk for PONV, undergoing breast cancer surgery with standardised propofol anaesthesia and antiemetics. After exclusions for clinical reasons and failed genotyping, 815 patients were included with 187 PONV cases and 628 controls. Emergence of PONV up to 7th post-operative day was recorded. PONV at 2-24 h after surgery was selected to be the primary outcome. The GWAS explored associations between PONV and 653 034 genetic variants. Replication attempts included 31 variants in 16 genes. RESULTS: The overall incidence of PONV up to 7th post-operative day was 35%, where 3% had PONV at 0-2 h and 23% at 2-24 h after surgery. Age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists status, the amount of oxycodone used in the post-anaesthesia care unit, smoking status, previous PONV, and history of motion sickness were statistically significant predictive factors in the logistic model. The receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.79) was calculated for the model. The GWAS identified six variants with suggestive association to PONV (p < 1 x 10(-5) ). Of the previously reported variants, association with the DRD2 variant rs18004972 (TaqIA) was replicated (p = .028).

Single-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci for smoking and AUD. However, GWASs that have aimed to identify loci contributing to co-occurring smoking and AUD have used small samples and thus have not been highly informative. Applying multi-trait analysis of GWASs (MTAG), we conducted a joint GWAS of smoking and AUD with data from the Million Veteran Program (N = 318,694). By leveraging GWAS summary statistics for AUD, MTAG identified 21 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with smoking initiation and 17 loci associated with smoking cessation compared to 16 and 8 loci, respectively, identified by single-trait GWAS. The novel loci for smoking behaviors identified by MTAG included those previously associated with psychiatric or substance use traits. Colocalization analysis identified 10 loci shared by AUD and smoking status traits, all of which achieved GWS in MTAG, including variants on SIX3, NCAM1, and near DRD2. Functional annotation of the MTAG variants highlighted biologically important regions on ZBTB20, DRD2, PPP6C, and GCKR that contribute to smoking behaviors. In contrast, MTAG of smoking behaviors and alcohol consumption (AC) did not enhance discovery compared with single-trait GWAS for smoking behaviors.

This study aimed to determine the biological activities of quercetin and its metabolite products, as well as the molecular mechanisms of quercetin in cognitive impairment (CI) and Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Key methods used were MetaTox, PASS Online, ADMETlab 2.0, SwissADME, CTD MicroRNA MIENTURNE, AutoDock, and Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total of 28 quercetin metabolite compounds were identified by phase I reactions (hydroxylation and hydrogenation reactions) and phase II reactions (methylation, O-glucuronidation, and O-sulfation reactions). Quercetin and its metabolites were found to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2. The studied compounds demonstrated significant gastrointestinal absorption and satisfied Lipinsky's criterion. Due to their high blood-brain barrier permeability, P-glycoprotein inhibition, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant capabilities, quercetin and its metabolite products have been proposed as promising molecular targets for the therapy of CI and PD.

DESIGN: Our drug repurposing strategy combines artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical corroboration and mechanisms of action analysis being implemented in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to explore the impact of gene polymorphism on the efficacy of antiparkinsonian drugs. The identification of factors associated with treatment effectiveness variability might assist the creation of a more tailored pharmacological therapy with higher efficacy, fewer side outcomes, and cheaper costs. METHODS: In this review, we conducted a thorough search in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and critically examined current discoveries on Parkinson's disease pharmacogenetics. The ethnicity of the individuals, research methodologies, and potential bias of these studies were thoroughly compared, with the primary focus on consistent conclusions. RESULTS: This review provides a summary of the existing data on PD pharmacogenetics, identifies its limitations, and offers insights that may be beneficial for future research. Previous studies have investigated the impact of gene polymorphism on the effectiveness and adverse effects of levodopa. The trendiest genes are the COMT gene, DAT gene, and DRD2 gene. However, limited study on other anti-Parkinson's drugs has been conducted. CONCLUSION: Therefore, In order to develop an individualized precision treatment for PD, it is an inevitable trend to carry out multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials of PD pharmacogenomics covering common clinical anti-PD drugs in large, homogeneous cohorts.", "first_author": "Liu, Jia-Si", "date_published": "2023"}, {"pmid": "36566472", "title": "Rasd2 Mediates Acute Fasting-Induced Antidepressant-Like Effects via Dopamine D2 Receptor Activation in Ovariectomized Mice.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that estrogen and acute fasting for 9 hours have antidepressant-like effects by reducing immobility time in the forced swimming test. Estrogen and acute fasting share a common regulatory gene, Rasd2. RASD2 regulates dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) transmission, but the role of Rasd2 in the DRD2-mediated antidepressant-like effect of acute fasting has not been examined. METHODS: In this study, open field test, forced swimming test, tail suspension test and sucrose preference test were used for behavioral assessments. RNA-seq, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore the role of Rasd2 in a depression model induced by ovariectomy and the antidepressant-like effects of 9-hour fasting. RESULTS: The RNA seq results showed that acute fasting induced a significant change in Rasd2 gene expression. Depression-like behaviors induced by ovariectomy were associated with decreased RASD2 and DRD2 protein levels in the hippocampus, and Rasd2 overexpression in the hippocampus alleviated depression-like behaviors and increased DRD2 expression. Nine-hour fasting had antidepressant-like effects in ovariectomized mice by upregulating the protein levels of RASD2, DRD2, CREB-BDNF, Akt, and estrogen receptor beta, and these effects can be blocked by DRD2 antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Rasd2 and DRD2 play pivotal roles in depression-like behavior induced by ovariectomy. Rasd2 regulates DRD2-mediated antidepressant-like effects of acute fasting in ovariectomized mice. Rasd2 can therefore be postulated to be a potential therapeutic target for depression and perhaps also a potential predictive marker for depression.", "first_author": "Cheng, Ziqian", "date_published": "2023 March 22"}, {"pmid": "36535207", "title": "Network pharmacology and LC-MS approachs to explore the active compounds and mechanisms of Yuanjiang decoction for treating bradyarrhythmia.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yuanjiang decoction (YJD), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, has been found to have a significant heart rate-increasing effect and is effective in the treatment of symptomatic bradyarrhythmia in previous studies. However, its specific components and potential mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we detected and identified the main compounds of YJD using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Through the approach of network pharmacology, we predicted the core targets of the active components, bradyarrhythmia targets, and obtained potential anti-bradyarrhythmia targets of YJD. We further performed protein to protein interaction (PPI), gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analyses for core targets, and constructed network of key active ingredients-core targets of YJD. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were performed for key active ingredients and core targets. RESULTS: The YJD contains a total of 35 main chemical components. The key active ingredients-core targets network contains 36 nodes and 90 edges, including 20 key active ingredients and 16 core targets. The core targets in the PPI network were TP53, TNF, HRAS, PPARG, IL1B, KCNH2, SCN5A, IDH1, LMNA, ACHE, F2, DRD2, CALM1, KCNQ1, TNNI3, IDH2 and TNNT2. KEGG pathway analysis showed that YJD treatment of bradyarrhythmia mainly involves neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, cAMP signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, cholinergic synaptic and serotonergic synapse signaling pathway. The biological processes mainly include regulation of hormone levels, regulation of cardiac contraction, chemical synaptic transmission, circadian rhythm, positive regulation of heart rate, smooth muscle contraction, response to metal ion, oxidation-reduction process, neurotransmitter transport and import across plasma membrane. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation results showed that hesperidin and tetrahydropalmatine had higher affinity with DRD2 and KCNQ1, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the pharmacodynamic material basis of YJD and its potential multicomponent-multitarget-multipathway pharmacological effects, predicted its potential anti-bradyarrhythmia mechanism may be related to the regulation of myocardial autonomic nervous function and related ion channels.

It has been found that the response to the drug and the risk of adverse metabolic effects can be related to gene polymorphisms. A reduced dose is recommended for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers; moreover, it is postulated that other polymorphisms including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, DRD2, and 5-HTRs genes influence the therapeutic effect of ARI.

Studies have shown that the dysfunction of the dopaminergic system is related to a variety of pathophysiology of AD, and the expression of Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in the brains of AD patients and animal models is significantly downregulated, suggesting that DRD2 may represent a therapeutic target for AD. However, the strategy of targeting DRD2 for AD treatment still lacks some key experimental evidences. Here we show that DRD2 agonist Bromocriptine improved Abeta(1-42) induced neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and memory deficits in mice. For animal study, the mice have injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with Abeta(1-42)(410 pmol/5 mul) to induced AD cognitive deficit model (Mazzola et al., 2003; van der Stelt et al., 2006). After 7 days, Bromocriptine (2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) or normal saline was administered intragastrically once a day for 30 days. Behavioral tests about the Y maze and Morris water maze in mice were initiated on the twenty-fourth day of drug administration for 7 days. In vivo and in vitro mechanism research revealed that Bromocriptine, via activating DRD2, promoted the recruitment of PP2A and JNK by scaffold protein beta-arrestin 2, that repressed JNK-mediated transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia. Collectively, our findings suggest that Bromocriptine can ameliorate Abeta(1-42) induced neuroinflammation and memory deficits in mice through DRD2/beta-arrestin 2/PP2A/JNK signaling axis, which provides an experimental basis for the development of Bromocriptine as a drug for AD.", "first_author": "Liu, Xin", "date_published": "2023 January 5"}, {"pmid": "36437548", "title": "The ANKK1/DRD2 gene TaqIA polymorphism (rs1800497) is associated with the severity of extrapyramidal side effects of haloperidol treatment in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are one of the most prominent side effects of haloperidol.

We conducted a 3-week prospective study to investigate the associations of ANKK1/DRD2 TaqIA (rs1800497), DRD2 -141C Ins/Del (rs1799732) polymorphisms and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype on the efficacy of haloperidol treatment and severity of EPS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHODS: In total, 57 inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (24 (42.1%)) females; age -46.7 (11.8) years (M(SD)) of European ancestry were enrolled. BARS and SAS scales were used to assess EPS. PANSS and CGI scales - to assess the efficacy of haloperidol treatment. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype was predicted by the CYP2D6 *3, *4, *5, *6, *9, *10, *41 and xN genotypes. RESULTS: Minor C allele of TaqIA was associated with higher scores of BARS (p=0.029) and SAS (p=0.024) on day 21 and minor Del allele of -141C Ins/Del - with more prominent clinical improvement by CGI scale (p=0.007) but not by PANSS.

In particular, the impairment of postsynaptic dopamine 2 and 3 receptors (DRD2/3) in the ventral and dorsal striatum during the development and maintenance of alcohol addiction has been investigated in several positron emission tomography (PET) studies. However, it is unclear whether these changes are the result of adaptation or genetic predisposition. METHODS: Here we investigated the association between DRD2/ankyrin repeat and kinase domain-containing 1 (ANKK1) TaqIA allele (rs1800497) status and striatal DRD2/3 availability measured by 18F-fallypride PET in 12 AUD patients and 17 sex-matched healthy controls. Age and smoking status were included as covariates. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, TaqIA allele status was not associated with striatal DRD2/3 availability in either group and there was no significant difference between groups, possibly due to the relatively small sample size (N = 29).

PANDAS has been known to cause a sudden onset of reward deficiency syndrome (RDS). RDS includes multiple disorders that are characterized by dopaminergic signaling dysfunction in the brain reward cascade (BRC), which may result in addiction, depression, avoidant behaviors, anxiety, tic disorders, and/or OCD. According to research by Blum et al., the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms are important prevalent genetic determinants of RDS. The literature demonstrates that infections like Borrelia and Lyme, as well as other infections like group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS), can cause an autoimmune reaction and associated antibodies target dopaminergic loci in the mesolimbic region of the brain, which interferes with brain function and potentially causes RDS-like symptoms/behaviors. The treatment of PANDAS remains controversial, especially since there have been limited efficacy studies to date. We propose an innovative potential treatment for PANDAS based on previous clinical trials using a pro-dopamine regulator known as KB220 variants.

However, the chemical constituents and molecular mechanisms of TCFW still remain unknown. In this study, chemical profiling with UHPLC-QE-MS/MS, network pharmacology and molecular docking were integrated to fastly explore the potential chemicals and mechanisms of TCFW against AD. A total of 31 chemical components in TCFW were detected and identified compared with the solvent wine of TCFW by UHPLC-QE-MS/MS.

METHODS: Saliva samples of 54 opioid-exposed and sex- and age-matched non-exposed neonates underwent transcriptomic analysis of inflammatory and reward genes. A subset of 22 neonates underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate white matter injury commonly associated with inflammatory response. Gene expression and brain MRI were compared between opioid- and non-exposed neonates and further stratified by sex and pharmacotherapy need. RESULTS: Opioid-exposed females regardless of pharmacotherapy need had higher expression of inflammatory genes than their male counterparts, with notable differences in the expression of CCL2 and CXCL1 in females requiring pharmacotherapy (p = 0.01 and 0.06, respectively). Opioid-exposed males requiring pharmacotherapy had higher expression of DRD2 than exposed females (p = 0.07), validating our prior research. Higher expression of IL1beta, IL6, TNFalpha, and IL10 was seen in opioid-exposed neonates with T1 white matter hyperintensity (WMH) compared to exposed neonates without WMH (p < 0.05).

Interestingly, selective supplementation with F. rodentium or its metabolic products, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is sufficient to rescue anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in HFD-fed mice. Next, we determined that the transcriptional level of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), which activation usually inhibits inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), is significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of XYS-treated mice when compared with that of vehicle-treated controls. Moreover, enriched pathways analysis with the differential expression genes (DEGs) showed that some of these DEGs are enriched in neuroinflammatory pathways. We further noticed that treatment with XYS contributes to controlling microglial activation and proinflammatory responses in the mPFC and hippocampus of HFD-fed mice.

Unfortunately, the current therapeutic practice, generally depending on the serotonergic system for drug treatment is unsatisfactory and shows intractable side effects. Multiple evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) and dopaminergic signals associated with neuroinflammation are highly involved in the pathophysiology of depression as well as in the mechanism of antidepressant drugs, which is still in the early stage of study and well worthy of investigation. METHODS: We established two chronic stress models, including chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), to complementarily recapitulate depression-like behaviors. Then, hippocampal tissues were used to detect inflammation-related molecules and signaling pathways. Pathological changes in depressive mouse hippocampal astrocytes were examined by RNA sequencing. After confirming the dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2)/beta-arrestin2 signaling changes in the depressive mice brain, we then established the depressive mouse model using the beta-arrestin2 knockout mice or administrating the beta-arrestin2-biased Drd2 agonist to investigate the roles. Label-free mass spectrometry was used to identify the beta-arrestin2-binding proteins as the underlying mechanisms. We modeled neuroinflammation with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticosterone treatment and characterized astrocytes using multiple methods including cell viability assay, flow cytometry, and confocal immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Drd2-biased beta-arrestin2 pathway is significantly changed in the progression of depression, and genetic deletion of beta-arrestin2 aggravates neuroinflammation and depressive-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, astrocytic beta-arrestin2 retains STAT3 in the cytoplasm by structural combination with STAT3, therefore, inhibiting the JAK-STAT3 pathway-mediated inflammatory activation.

Q808 is an innovative antiepileptic chemical. It exerts effective antiepileptic effect against various epilepsy models. Exploring the gene transcriptomic profile of long-term treatment of Q808 is necessary. In the present study, hippocampus RNA-sequencing was performed to reveal the transcriptome profile of rats before and after treatment of Q808 for 28 d. Results confirmed 51 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Q808 and healthy control groups. Gene cluster analysis showed that most upregulated DEGs linked to response to drug and nucleus, most downregulated DEGs linked to locomotory, neuronal cell body, and drug binding. Most of DEGs were enriched in the signaling transduction, substance dependence, nervous system, and neurodegenerative disease pathways. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed that Q808 significantly increased the expression of neuroprotective genes, such as Mdk, and decreased the mRNA levels of Penk, Drd1, and Adora2a, which are highly expressed in epilepsy models. In addition, Q808 decreased the mRNA expression of Pde10A and Drd2, which are known to be closely associated with schizophrenia.

METHODS: We used LacDrd2KO females with lifelong severe hyperprolactinemia due dopamine-D2 receptor deletion from lactotropes, and slow onset of metabolic disturbances, and compared them to their respective controls (Drd2 (loxP/loxP) ). Food intake, and binge eating was evaluated. We then challenged mice with a High Fat (HFD) or a Control Diet (CD) for 8 weeks, beginning at 3 months of age, when no differences in body weight are found between genotypes. At the end of the protocol brown and white adipose tissues were weighed, and thermogenic and lipogenic markers studied, using real time PCR (Ucp1, Cidea, Pgc1a, Lpl, adiponectin, Prlr) or immunohistochemistry (UCP1). Histochemical analysis of brown adipose tissue, and glucose tolerance tests were performed. RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemic mice had increased food intake and binge eating behavior. Metabolic effects induced by a HFD were exacerbated in lacDrd2KO mice. Hyperprolactinemia aggravated HFD-induced body weight gain and glucose intolerance. In brown adipose tissue pronounced cellular whitening as well as decreased expression of the thermogenic markers Ucp1 and Pgc1a were observed in response to high prolactin levels, regardless of the diet, and furthermore, hyperprolactinemia potentiated the decrease in Cidea mRNA expression induced by HFD. In subcutaneous white adipose tissue hyperprolactinemia synergistically increased tissue weight, while decreasing Prlr, Adiponectin and Lpl mRNA levels regardless of the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological hyperprolactinemia has a strong impact in brown adipose tissue, lowering thermogenic markers and evoking tissue whitening. Furthermore, it modifies lipogenic markers in subcutaneous white adipose, and aggravates HFD-induced glucose intolerance and Cidea decrease. Therefore, severe high prolactin levels may target BAT function, and furthermore represent an adjuvant player in the development of obesity induced by high fat diets.", "first_author": "Lopez-Vicchi, Felicitas", "date_published": "2022"}, {"pmid": "35588917", "title": "Cannabis induced psychosis: A systematic review on the role of genetic polymorphisms.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabis sativa is a recreational drug commonly consumed in Europe and is getting popularity for both recreational and therapeutic use. In some individuals, the use of cannabis leads to psychotic disorders. This systematic review summarizes the current evidence linking genetic polymorphisms and inter-individual susceptibility to psychosis induced by cannabis. METHOD: Studies published from 2005 to 2020 were identified through Medline using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus database and searches were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Initial search was performed with terms: \"cannabis induced psychosis\" AND \"genetics\". RESULTS: From the initial group of 108 papers, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Many of the findings revealed associations with genetic polymorphisms modulations of genes involved directly (COMT, DRD2 and DAT) or indirectly (AKT1) to dopamine pathways. The most consistent finding was with COMT rs4680, where the presence of the Val allele was associated with a higher risk for cannabis-induced psychosis. This higher susceptibility was also reported for AKT1 (rs2494732) with the CC genotype. Of note, the only genome-wide association study identified a significant signal close to the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 represented by rs115455482 and rs74722579 predisposing to cannabis-induced hallucinations and remarkably no dopaminergic target was found. CONCLUSION: Actual evidence supports the role of dopamine in cannabis induced psychosis.

The persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is the major cause of treatment failure with RCC. Recent evidence showed that dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-targeting antipsychotic drugs such as penfluridol exert oncostatic effects on several cancer types, but the effect of penfluridol on RCC remains unknown. Here, we uncovered penfluridol suppressed in vitro cell growth and in vivo tumorigenicity of various RCC cell lines (Caki-1, 786-O, A498, and ACHN) and enhanced the Sutent (sunitinib)-triggered growth inhibition on clear cell (cc)RCC cell lines. Mechanistically, upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) was critical for autophagy-mediated apoptosis induced by penfluridol. Transcriptional inhibition of OCT4 and Nanog via inhibiting GLI1 was important for penfluridol-induced stemness and proliferation inhibition. The anticancer activities of penfluridol on ccRCC partially occurred through DRD2. In clinical ccRCC specimens, positive correlations of DRD2 with GLI1, OCT4, and Nanog were observed and their expressions were correlated with worse prognoses. Summarizing, DRD2 antagonists such as penfluridol induce UPR signaling and suppress the GLI1/OCT4/Nanog axis in ccRCC cells to reduce their growth through inducing autophagy-mediated apoptosis and stemness inhibition.

The main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples.

Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota.

ONC201 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced arrest in G1 phase, and increased cellular stress and apoptosis, accompanied by dual inhibition of the AKT/mTOR/S6 and MAPK pathways in OC cells. ONC201 also resulted in inhibition of adhesion and invasion via epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduction of VEGF expression. Pre-treatment with the anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), reversed the ONC201-induced oxidative stress response, and prevented ONC201-reduced VEGF and cell invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition protein expression. Knockdown of ClpP in ovarian cancer cells reduced ONC201 mediated the anti-tumor activity and cellular stress. Diet-induced obesity accelerated ovarian tumor growth in the KpB mouse model.

Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a gene implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia, and we have found elevated levels of the D2R-DISC1 complex in the postmortem brain tissue of patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: We used coimmunoprecipitation to measure D2R-DISC1 complex levels in peripheral blood samples from patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls in 3 cohorts (including males and females) from different hospitals. We also used label-free mass spectrometry to conduct proteomic analysis of these samples. RESULTS: Levels of the D2R-DISC1 complex were elevated in the peripheral blood samples of patients with schizophrenia from 3 independent cohorts, and were normalized with antipsychotic treatment. Proteomic analysis of the blood samples from patients with high D2R-DISC1 complex levels that were normalized with antipsychotic treatment revealed a number of altered proteins and pathways associated with D2R, DISC1 and the D2R-DISC1 complex.

Polyphenols such as resveratrol, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, that are known for antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, are present in grapes. The objective of this work was to determine if the dietary intake of grapes has the potential of alleviating HFD-induced deficiencies. (2) Methods: The effect of dietary grape intake was studied using behavioral assays and high throughput genome-wide RNA transcriptome analyses with female C57BL6/J mice. (3) Results: Mice that were fed a HFD from 3-weeks of age showed anxiety-like behaviors compared with the standard diet (STD). This HFD-induced effect was attenuated by supplementing the HFD with 1% grape powder (HF1G) (open field test). Similar results were observed with the novel object recognition test; there was a significant difference in time spent exploring a novel object between the HFD and the HF1G groups. There was no significant difference between the HFD1G and the STD groups. Based on the RNA-Seq analysis, genetic expression in the brain varied as a result of diet, with 210, 360, and 221 uniquely expressed genes in the STD, HFD, and HF1G groups, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed that the HFIG group mapped more closely with the STD group than the HFD group. Focusing on some specific areas, based on genetic expression, Dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) was increased in the HFD group and normalized in the HF1G group, relative to the STD group. In addition, as judged by cluster hierarchy, the expression of genes that are associated with the dopamine receptor 2 pathway were increased in the HFD group, whereas the pattern that was derived from mouse brain from the HF1G group showed greater similarity to the STD group. KEGG pathway analyses were consistent with these results. For example, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (KEGG ID: mmu04080) was altered due to HFD compared with STD, but normalized by grape supplementation or the HFD; there was no significant difference between the STD and HF1G groups.

Our previous research suggests that HERV-W Envelope (HERV-W ENV), a HERV-W family envelope protein, is elevated in schizophrenia patients and contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The dopamine (DA) hypothesis is the cornerstone in research and clinical practice related to schizophrenia. Here, we found that the concentration of DA and the expression of DA receptor D2 (DRD2) were significantly higher in schizophrenia patients than in healthy individuals. Intriguingly, there was a positive correlation between HERV-W ENV and DA concentration. Depth analyses showed that there was a marked consistency between HERV-W ENV and DRD2 in schizophrenia. Studies in vitro indicated that HERV-W ENV could increase the DA concentration by regulating DA metabolism and induce the expression of DRD2. Co-IP assays and laser confocal scanning microscopy indicated cellular colocalization and a direct interaction between DRD2 and HERV-W ENV. Additionally, HERV-W ENV caused structural and functional abnormalities of DA neurons. Further studies showed that HERV-W ENV could trigger the PP2A/AKT1/GSK3 pathway via DRD2.

We analyzed socio-demographic data, the intensity of psychiatric symptoms, the duration of psychosis and of LAI treatment, and the cardiac EF measured with TSTE. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences between the four antipsychotics regarding the values of the EF. Nevertheless, we observed a trend indicating that patients treated with an antipsychotic associated with a lower affinity for the DRD2, such as Olanzapine, have higher EF values than patients treated with antipsychotics with a stronger binding to the DRD2, such as Paliperidone and Risperidone. Patients receiving Aripiprazole, which has the strongest affinity for the DRD2 from all four antipsychotics but is also a partial DRD2 agonist, display higher EF values than those on Paliperidone and Risperidone.

ONC201 is an imipridone that selectively antagonizes the G protein-coupled receptors dopamine receptor D2 and D3 (DRD2/3) and activates human mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). It is a promising first-in-class small molecule that has been reported to have anti-neoplastic activity in various types of cancer through induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) as well as through stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and subsequent induction of apoptosis. ONC201 is being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including EC. ONC206 is an analog of ONC201 with nanomolar potency in Phase I clinical trials. This study evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of ONC206 in EC cell lines and the Lkb1(fl/fl)p53(fl/fl) genetically engineered mouse model of endometrioid EC. ONC206 revealed greater potency than ONC201 in the inhibition of proliferation in EC cell lines, with IC50 concentration ranges of 0.21-0.32 microM for ONC026 versus 2.14-3.53 microM for ONC201. ONC206 induced cellular stress, apoptosis and cell cycle G1 arrest, accompanied by inhibition of the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathways in EC cells. Diet-induced obesity accelerated tumor growth in Lkb1(fl/fl)p53(fl/fl) mice. ONC206 inhibited EC tumor size and weight in both obese and lean mice after 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with ONC206 led to a decrease in expression of Ki67, BCL-XL and phosphorylation of S6, as well as an increase in ClpP in endometrial tumors under both obese and lean conditions.

Administration of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (KET) induces cognitive impairment in animals, producing effects similar to those observed in schizophrenic patients. In a previous study, we showed that KET (20 mg/kg) induces cognitive deficits in mice and that administration of clozapine (CLZ) reverses this effect. To identify biochemical mechanisms related to CLZ actions in the context of KET-induced impairment, we performed a biochemical analysis using the same experimental paradigm-acute and sub-chronic administration of these drugs (0.3 and 1 mg/kg). METHODS: Since the effect of CLZ mainly depends on G-protein-related receptors, we used the Signaling PathwayFinder Kit to identify 84 genes involved in GPCR-related signal transduction and then verified the genes that were statistically significantly different on a larger group of mice using RT-PCR and Western blot analyses after the administration of acute and sub-chronic drugs. RESULTS: Of the 84 genes involved in GPCR-related signal transduction, the expression of six, betaarrestin1, betaarrestin2, galanin receptor 2 (GalR2), dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), was significantly altered. Since these genes affect the levels of other signaling proteins, e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Grk2), and G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium 3 (Girk3), we determined their levels in PFC using Western blot. Most of the observed changes occurred after acute treatment with 0.3 mg/kg CLZ. We showed that acute treatment with CLZ at a lower dose significantly increased betaarrestin1 and ERK1/2. KET treatment induced the upregulation of betaarrestin1. Joint administration of these drugs had no effect on the betaarrestin1 level. CONCLUSION: The screening kit we used to study the expression of GPCR-related signal transduction allowed us to select several important genes affected by CLZ.

METHODS: Joint genotyping approach was used to derive variants of GIH and ITU independently. SNPs of both these populations with significant allele frequency variation (minor allele frequency >/= 0.05) with super-populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and gnomAD based on Chi-square distribution with p-value of </= 0.05 and Bonferroni's multiple adjustment tests were identified.

Dopamine agonists (DAs) such as bromocriptine (BRC) are the first-line treatment for prolactinomas, but the resistance rate is increasing year by year, creating a clinical challenge. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the molecular mechanism of bromocriptine resistance in prolactinomas. Activation of the P38 MAPK pathway affects multidrug resistance in tumours. Our previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting MAPK14 can suppress the occurrence of prolactinoma, but the role of MAPK11/12/13/14 (p38 MAPK) signalling in dopamine agonist-resistant prolactinomas is still unclear. METHODS: A prolactinoma rat model was established to determine the effect of bromocriptine on MAPK11/12/13/14 signalling. DA-resistant GH3 cells and DA-sensitive MMQ cells were used, and the role of MAPK11/12/13/14 in bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas was preliminarily verified by western blot, RT-qPCR, ELISA, flow cytometry and CCK-8 experiments. The effects of MAPK11 or MAPK14 on bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas were further verified by siRNA transfection experiments. RESULTS: Bromocriptine was used to treat rat prolactinoma by upregulating DRD2 expression and downregulating the expression level of MAPK11/12/13/14 in vivo experiments. The in vitro experiments showed that GH3 cells are resistant to bromocriptine and that MMQ cells are sensitive to bromocriptine. Bromocriptine could significantly reduce the expression of MAPK12 and MAPK13 in GH3 cells and MMQ cells. Bromocriptine could significantly reduce the expression of MAPK11, MAPK14, NF-kappaB p65 and Bcl2 in MMQ but had no effect on MAPK11, MAPK14, NF-kappaB p65 and Bcl2 in GH3 cells. In addition, knockdown of MAPK11 and MAPK14 in GH3 cells by siRNA transfection reversed the resistance of GH3 cells to bromocriptine, and haloperidol (HAL) blocked the inhibitory effect of bromocriptine on MAPK14, MAPK11, and PRL in MMQ cells. Our findings show that MAPK11 and MAPK14 proteins are involved in bromocriptine resistance in prolactinomas. CONCLUSION: Bromocriptine reduces the expression of MAPK11/12/13/14 in prolactinomas, and MAPK11 and MAPK14 are involved in bromocriptine resistance in prolactinomas by regulating apoptosis.

No targeted therapies are available for CRPC-NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial-omics, and a synthetic hydrogel-based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC-NEPCs are defined. Short-term culture in tumor-expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC-NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small-molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient-derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti-tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC-NEPCs under drug-resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment.

The cause of dopaminergic loss in PD remains unknown for a long time, however, recent reports suggest oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. Paraquat (PQ), a widely used herbicide is an oxidative stress inducer that has been implicated as a potential risk factor for the development of PD. Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that display a variety of therapeutic properties against oxidative stress. Naringenin (NAR), a natural flavonoid, exhibits neuroprotection against PD-related pathology. However, studies on its neuroprotective role and the underlying mechanisms are scarce, therefore the present study explored the potential neuroprotective role of NAR in PQ-induced parkinsonism in SH-SY5Y cells and rat model. The effect of NAR on PQ-induced cellular toxicity was determined by measuring cell viability, oxidative stress, ATP levels and the same effect was determined by assessing behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical, qRT-PCR and Western blot in rat model. NAR treatment in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased cell viability, reduced oxidative stress, elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, and higher cellular ATP levels. In rats, NAR treatment resulted in significant neuroprotection against PQ-induced behavioral deficits, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and astrocytosis. NAR treatment significantly modulated PQ-induced mRNA expressions of DRD2, DAT, LRRK2, SNCA, beta-catenin, caspase-3, BDNF genes.

While Hippo/YAP (Yes-associated protein) signaling is essential for liver regeneration, its aberrant activation frequently leads to fibrosis and tumorigenesis. Unravelling \"context-specific\" contributions of YAP in liver repair might help selectively bypass fibrosis and preserve the pro-regenerative YAP function in hepatic diseases. METHODS: We used murine liver fibrosis and minipig NASH models, and liver biopsies from patients with cirrhosis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed, and a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand screening system was used to identify cell-selective YAP inhibitors. RESULTS: YAP levels in macrophages are increased in the livers of humans and mice with liver fibrosis. The increase in type I interferon and attenuation of hepatic fibrosis observed in mice specifically lacking Yap1 in myeloid cells provided further evidence for the fibrogenic role of macrophage YAP. ScRNA-Seq further showed that defective YAP pathway signaling in macrophages diminished a fibrogenic vascular endothelial cell subset that exhibited profibrotic molecular signatures such as angiocrine CTGF and VCAM1 expression. To specifically target fibrogenic YAP in macrophages, we utilized a GPCR ligand screening system and identified a dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) antagonist that selectively blocked YAP in macrophages but not hepatocytes. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of macrophage DRD2 attenuated liver fibrosis. In a large animal (minipig) NASH model recapitulating human pathology, the DRD2 antagonist blocked fibrosis and restored hepatic architecture. CONCLUSIONS: DRD2 antagonism selectively targets YAP-dependent fibrogenic crosstalk between macrophages and CTGF(+)VCAM1(+) vascular niche, promoting liver regeneration over fibrosis in both rodent and large animal models. LAY SUMMARY: Fibrosis in the liver is one of the main histological determinants of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a disease paralleling a worldwide surge in metabolic syndromes.

METHODS: This study included adult patients with ICD-10 diagnoses of schizophrenia and current acute psychosis who were treated with antipsychotics. All patients underwent genotyping for DRD2 rs2514218 polymorphism. The definition of overall treatment response was based on changes in treatment scheme: no changes indicated a good response, and changes indicated a limited response.

The present study investigated the effects of maternal oral ethanol (EtOH) exposure (0, 10, or 12.5 % in drinking water) from gestational day 6 until day 21 post-delivery (weaning) on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis at weaning and in adulthood on postnatal day 77 in rat offspring. At weaning, type-3 neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were decreased in the subgranular zone (SGZ), accompanied by Chrnb2 downregulation and Grin2b upregulation in the dentate gyrus (DG). These results suggested suppression of CHRNB2-mediated cholinergic signaling in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the DG hilus and increased glutamatergic signaling through the NR2B subtype of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, resulting in NPC reduction. In contrast, upregulation of Chrna7 may increase CHRNA7-mediated cholinergic signaling in immature granule cells, and upregulation of Ntrk2 may cause an increase in somatostatin-immunoreactive ((+)) GABAergic interneurons, suggesting a compensatory response against NPC reduction. Promotion of SGZ cell proliferation increased type-2a NPCs. Moreover, an increase in calbindin-d-29 K(+) interneurons and upregulation of Reln, Drd2, Tgfb2, Il18, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor subunit genes might participate in this compensatory response.

In the DG hilus, gliosis and hyper-ramified microglia, accompanying upregulation of C3, appeared at weaning, suggesting contribution to suppressed synaptic plasticity in adulthood. M1 microglia increased throughout adulthood, suggesting sustained neuroinflammation. These results indicate that maternal EtOH exposure temporarily disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis and later suppresses synaptic plasticity.

The underlying mechanisms of the genetic underpinnings in the susceptibility and treatment response of opioid use disorder remain elusive. OBJECTIVES: To reveal the potential associations of genotypes and gene methylations of dopaminergic system genes, as well as roles of them in opioid use disorder. In the present study, we detected the DNA methylation in the promoter regions of five representative dopaminergic system genes (DRD1, DRD2, SLC6A3, TH, and COMT) between 120 patients with heroin use disorder in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program and 111 healthy controls. The associations of 25 SNPs in the above genes and methylation of 237 CpG sites, known as methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), were determined. Then, the correlations of the above mQTLs and traits of heroin use disorder were analyzed in a sample set of 801 patients with heroin use disorder and 930 healthy controls.

Recent studies identified that ONC201 antagonizes D2-like dopamine receptors at therapeutically relevant concentrations. In the current study, characterization of ONC201 using radioligand binding and multiple functional assays revealed that it was a full antagonist of the D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) with low micromolar potencies, similar to its potency for antiproliferative effects. Curve-shift experiments using D2R-mediated beta-arrestin recruitment and cAMP assays revealed that ONC201 exhibited a mixed form of antagonism. An operational model of allostery was used to analyze these data, which suggested that the predominant modulatory effect of ONC201 was on dopamine efficacy with little to no effect on dopamine affinity. To investigate how ONC201 binds to the D2R, we employed scanning mutagenesis coupled with a D2R-mediated calcium efflux assay. Eight residues were identified as being important for ONC201's functional antagonism of the D2R. Mutation of these residues followed by assessing ONC201 antagonism in multiple signaling assays highlighted specific residues involved in ONC201 binding. Together with computational modeling and simulation studies, our results suggest that ONC201 interacts with the D2R in a bitopic manner where the imipridone core of the molecule protrudes into the orthosteric binding site, but does not compete with dopamine, whereas a secondary phenyl ring engages an allosteric binding pocket that may be associated with negative modulation of receptor activity.

This study demonstrates that ONC201 antagonizes the D2 receptor with novel bitopic and negative allosteric mechanisms of action, which may explain its high selectivity and some of its clinical anticancer properties that are distinct from other D2 receptor antagonists widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.", "first_author": "Free, R Benjamin", "date_published": "2021 October"}, {"pmid": "34330229", "title": "Clinical and genetic factors associated with anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients: a cross-sectional study.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the progress in assessment and treatment of breast cancer, being diagnosed with it or receiving chemotherapy treatment is still conceived as a traumatic experience. Women develop negative thoughts about life and death with detrimental effects on their daily physical functioning/activities, emotional state and overall quality of life. The aim of our study was to evaluate the level of anxiety and depression among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and explore the correlation between these psychological disorders, clinical, sociodemographic and genetic factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among breast cancer patients undergoing intravenous chemotherapy at the oncology outpatient unit of Hotel-Dieu de France hospital (November 2017-June 2019; Ethical approval number: CEHDF1016). All patients gave their written informed consent and completed several validated scales, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) for the assessment of anxiety and depression. Sleep quality, insomnia, cognitive function, fatigue and pain were also evaluated. Genotyping for certain gene polymorphisms (CLOCK, PER2, CRY2, OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT, DRD2) was performed using the Lightcycler(R) (Roche). RESULTS: A total of 112 women was included. The prevalence of depression was 43.4%, and 56.2% of the patients reported anxiety (based on the HADS classification). Multivariable analysis showed that higher cognitive scores and taking fosaprepitant were significantly associated with lower depression and anxiety scores. Moreover, being married compared to single was also associated with lower depression scores, whereas higher PSQI scores (worse sleep quality) and having the PER2 AA variant genotype compared to GG were significantly associated with higher depression scores. Finally, reporting a more severe insomnia and having the COMT Met/Met genotype were significantly associated with a higher anxiety score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a strong relationship between depression scores and cognitive impairment, sleep quality, marital status, fosaprepitant intake, and PER2 polymorphism, while anxiety scores were correlated to cognitive impairment, insomnia severity, fosaprepitant intake, and COMT polymorphism.

Trazpiroben demonstrated the following receptor affinities: high for D(2) and D(3), moderate for D(4), and minimal for D(1) and D(5) It demonstrated moderate affinity for adrenergic alpha 1B (alpha (1B)) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 2A receptors and low potential for off-target adverse events (AEs). Trazpiroben potently inhibited dopamine-activated D(2L) receptor activation of cognate G-proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cell membranes and was a neutral D(2L) receptor antagonist. In vivo, trazpiroben dose-dependently increased prolactin release in orally dosed rat (0.1-1 mg/kg). Additionally, multiple oral doses in the rat (100 mg/kg) and dog (50 mg/kg) for 3 days produced robust plasma exposures and prolactin increases in both species. Trazpiroben inhibited retching/vomiting in the dog with apomorphine-induced emesis with a potency (0.1-1 mg/kg) like that of trazpiroben-mediated prolactin increases in rat. Oral trazpiroben (1, 10, and 30 mg/kg) did not affect rat rotarod performance, suggesting low brain penetration. Trazpiroben concentrations were low in cerebrospinal fluid versus plasma after multiple oral doses for 4 days in rat and dog. Trazpiroben weakly inhibited the hERG channel current (concentration causing half-maximal inhibition of control-specific binding of 15.6 microM), indicating little potential for disrupting cardiac rhythm. Overall, trazpiroben is a potent D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist designed to avoid the serious potential AEs associated with current gastroparesis therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Trazpiroben is a novel, potent dopamine D(2)/D(3) selective receptor antagonist designed to avoid adverse effects associated with the current pharmacological therapies metoclopramide and domperidone. Preclinical studies have demonstrated low brain penetration and weak affinity for the hERG channel, indicating that trazpiroben is not expected to be associated with central nervous system or cardiovascular safety issues. With these pharmacological properties, trazpiroben may represent a viable new treatment option for gastroparesis because of a potentially improved safety profile relative to existing therapies.", "first_author": "Whiting, Roger L", "date_published": "2021 October"}, {"pmid": "34245039", "title": "Menthol, a bioactive constituent of Mentha, attenuates motion sickness in mice model: Involvement of dopaminergic system.", "abstract": "Motion sickness (MS) occurs due to contradicting vestibular and visual inputs to the brain causing nausea and vomiting. Antidopaminergic drugs being effective in reducing MS create a path for effective therapy against MS by regulating dopamine levels. We aimed to evaluate the role of the striatum and brainstem dopamine and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in MS and the efficacy of menthol (MNT) to modulate dopamine and DRD2 in vitro and in vivo for possible amelioration of MS. Evaluation of efficacy of MNT to inhibit dopamine release from PC12 cells and anti-MS efficacy in BALB/c mice model was performed. Dopamine, DRD2 expression in PC12 cells, mice striatum, and brainstem were detected using HPLC-ECD, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis, respectively. DRD2 expression increased in calcium ionophore-treated PC12 cells compared with control cells. Pretreatment with 50 mug/ml menthol decreased dopamine and DRD2 expression. Similarly, dopamine and DRD2 levels in mice striatum and brainstem of MS group (rotation induced) increased significantly compared with control group NC (no rotation). Pretreatment with menthol at 50 mg/kg concentration (rotation induced) showed decreased dopamine and DRD2 expression, thus indicating ameliorative effect on MS. Hence, we suggest that increased striatum and brainstem dopamine and DRD2 levels might lead to MS symptoms, and menthol could be used as a potent herbal alternative medicine for MS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Antidopaminergic drugs being effective in reducing motion sickness (MS) creates a path for effective therapy against MS by regulating dopamine levels. Increased striatum and brainstem dopamine and Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) levels might lead to the MS symptoms induced by rotation stimulation in mice model. Menthol showed a prophylactic effect on rotation-induced MS by reducing striatal and brainstem dopamine levels, DRD2 mRNA, and protein expression.

Increasing cannabis use may elevate CHS prevalence, exacerbating a public health issue with attendant costs and morbidity. Objective, Design, and Data Source: This study, the largest contemporaneous database, investigated genetic mutations underlying CHS. Patients with CHS diagnosis and ongoing symptoms were compared with current cannabis users lacking symptoms. Target Population: A screening questionnaire was posted online. Of 585 respondents, 205 qualified as the CHS pool and 54 as controls; a reduced pool of 28 patients and 12 controls ultimately completed genomic testing. Results: Patients and controls were high-frequency users of cannabis flower or concentrates (93%), using multiple grams/day of THC-predominant material. Among patients, 15.6% carried diagnoses of cannabis dependency or addiction, and 56.6% experienced withdrawal symptoms. About 87.7% of patients improved after cannabis cessation, most suffering recurrence rapidly after resumption.

Pharmacogenetic variation is probably one of the causative factors for the observed interindividual differences in the response to and the side effects of antipsychotics, which could be addressed and whose negative effects could be avoided or mitigated. AIM: The present study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the frequency of DRD2 rs1799732, COMT rs4680, MC4R rs489693, and HTR2C rs3813929 in Bulgarian psychiatric patients.

We set out to compare patterns of dyskinetic behaviours induced by the systemic administration of L-DOPA and D1 or D2 receptor (D1R, D2R) agonists in mice with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. Mice were divided in four groups to receive increasing doses of L-DOPA, a D1R agonist (SKF38393), a D2/3 agonist (quinpirole), or a selective D2R agonist (sumanirole). Axial, limb and orofacial abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were rated using a well-established method, while dystonic features were quantified in different body segments using a new rating scale. Measures of abnormal limb and trunk posturing were extracted from high-speed videos using a software for markerless pose estimation (DeepLabCut). While L-DOPA induced the full spectrum of dyskinesias already described in this mouse model, SKF38393 induced mostly orofacial and limb AIMs. By contrast, both of the D2-class agonists (quinpirole, sumanirole) induced predominantly axial AIMs. Dystonia ratings revealed that these agonists elicited marked dystonic features in trunk/neck, forelimbs, and hindlimbs, which were overall more severe in sumanirole-treated mice. Accordingly, sumanirole induced pronounced axial bending and hindlimb divergence in the automated video analysis. In animals treated with SKF38393, the only appreciable dystonic-like reaction consisted in sustained tail dorsiflexion and stiffness. We next compared the effects of D1R or D2R selective antagonists in L-DOPA-treated mice, where only the D2R antagonist had a significant effect on dystonic features.

Over 97% of PD patients respond to a single dose of Atremorine (5 g, p.o.) 1 h after administration. This response is gender-, time-, dose-, and genotype-dependent, with optimal doses ranging from 5 to 20 g/day, depending upon disease severity and concomitant medication. Drug-free patients show an increase in DA levels from 12.14 +/- 0.34 pg/ml to 6463.21 +/- 1306.90 pg/ml; and patients chronically treated with anti-PD drugs show an increase in DA levels from 1321.53 +/- 389.94 pg/ml to 16,028.54 +/- 4783.98 pg/ml, indicating that Atremorine potentiates the dopaminergic effects of conventional anti-PD drugs. Atremorine also influences the levels of other neurotransmitters (adrenaline, noradrenaline) and hormones which are regulated by DA (e.g., prolactin, PRL), with no effect on serotonin or histamine. The variability in Atremorine-induced DA response is highly attributable to pharmacogenetic factors.

It has been reported that rhubarb possesses hepatotoxicity, but its mechanism in vivo is still unclear. METHODS: In this study, the chemical components in rhubarb were identified based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS combined with data postprocessing technology. The metabolic biomarkers obtained through metabolomics technology were related to rhubarb-induced hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, the potential targets of rhubarb-induced hepatotoxicity were obtained by network pharmacology involving the above components and metabolites. Meanwhile, GO gene enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed on the common targets. RESULTS: Twenty-eight components in rhubarb were identified based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, and 242 targets related to rhubarb ingredients were predicted. Nine metabolic biomarkers obtained through metabolomics technology were closely related to rhubarb-induced hepatotoxicity, and 282 targets of metabolites were predicted. Among them, the levels of 4 metabolites, namely dynorphin B (10-13), cervonoyl ethanolamide, lysoPE (18:2), and 3-hydroxyphenyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, significantly increased, while the levels of 5 metabolites, namely dopamine, biopterin, choline, coenzyme Q9 and P1, P4-bis (5'-uridyl) tetraphosphate significantly decreased.

However, peripheral dopamine directly modulates glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue (AT). We hypothesized that the dopaminergic system may be impaired in the adipose tissue of patients with T2D and that the therapeutic actions of bromocriptine could involve the modulation of metabolism in this tissue. METHODS: The expression of dopamine receptors was evaluated in visceral AT samples from patients with obesity and stratified in several groups: insulin sensitive (IS); insulin resistance (IR) normoglycaemic; insulin resistant prediabetic; insulin resistant diabetic, according to Ox-HOMA2IR, fasting glycaemia and HbA1c levels. T2D Goto-Kakizaki rats (GK) were fed a high-caloric diet (HCD) for five months and treated with bromocriptine (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in the last month. The levels of dopaminergic system mediators and markers of insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed in the peri-epididymal adipose tissue (pEWAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues, liver, and skeletal muscle. RESULTS: Patients with IR presented a decreasing trend of DRD1 expression in the visceral adipose tissue, being correlated with the expression of UCP1, PPARA, and insulin receptor (INSR) independently of insulin resistance and body mass index. Although no differences were observed in DRD2, DRD4 expression was significantly decreased in patients with prediabetes and T2D. In HCD-fed diabetic rats, bromocriptine increased D1R and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in pEWAT and the liver. Besides reducing adiposity, bromocriptine restored GLUT4 and PPARgamma levels in pEWAT, as well as postprandial InsR activation and postabsorptive activation of lipid oxidation pathways. A reduction of liver fat, GLUT2 levels and postprandial InsR and AMPK activation in the liver was observed. Increased insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 levels in BAT and an improvement of the overall metabolic status were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bromocriptine treatment remodels adipose tissue and the liver dopaminergic system, with increased D1R and TH levels, resulting in higher insulin sensitivity and catabolic function.

Using cells that were stably transfected with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles targeting CB(2) receptors, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5), and beta-arrestin 2, we found that CB(2) receptors regulated D(2) expression through a mechanism that is dependent on GRK5, beta-arrestin 2, and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2. We also found that repeated exposure to either ACEA or GP1a selectively stimulated the protein and mRNA expression of GRK proteins. ACEA significantly upregulated GRK2 proteins, whereas GP1a upregulated GRK5 protein expression. Our results identified mechanisms associated with the upregulation of D(2) receptors in neuronal cells after the repeated exposure to cannabinoids. These data can shed light on the mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent potential adverse effects, while simultaneously determining the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids.", "first_author": "Franklin, Jade M", "date_published": "2021 May 14"}, {"pmid": "33828379", "title": "Influence of DRD2 Polymorphisms on the Clinical Outcomes of Opioiddependent Patients on Methadone Maintenance Therapy.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is one of the dopamine receptors that have been studied in relation to opioid dependence. It is possible, therefore, that DRD2 gene (DRD2) polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes of patients with opioid dependence. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of DRD2 polymorphisms on the clinical outcomes of opioid-dependent patients on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with opioid dependence (n = 148) were recruited from MMT clinics. Pain sensitivity, severity of the opiate withdrawal syndrome, and sleep quality were assessed using cold pressor test (CPT), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS-M), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)-Malay, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood, and then was used for genotyping of Val96Ala, Leu141Leu, Val154Ile, Pro310Ser, Ser311Cys, TaqI A, -141C Ins/Del, and A-241G polymorphisms. RESULTS: Among 148 patients, 8.1% (n = 12), 60.8% (n = 90), 27.7% (n = 41), and 29.1% (n = 43) had at least one risk allele for Ser311Cys, TaqI A, -141C Ins/Del, and A-241G polymorphisms, respectively. There were no significant differences in pain responses (pain threshold, tolerance, and intensity), SOWS, and PSQI scores between DRD2 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The common DRD2 polymorphisms are not associated with pain sensitivity, severity of the opiate withdrawal syndrome, and sleep quality in patients with opioid dependence on MMT. However, this may be unique for Malays.

Among the various second-line treatment regimens, the treatment effect of the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is only effective for approximately half of patients; however, complete remission is rare. Here we report a patient with prolactinoma who was resistant to high-dose cabergoline (CAB) treatment, demonstrating a continuous increase in both the tumor volume and the prolactin (PRL) level. Given that this case is a refractory prolactinoma, the patient underwent two transsphenoidal approach (TSA) surgeries. The pathological analysis indicated that the Ki-67 index increased significantly from 3% to 30%, and the expression levels of DRD2 and MGMT were low. Finally, TMZ treatment was recommended. A total of six cycles of TMZ standard chemotherapy shrank the tumor volume and the tumor disappeared completely. During the 6-month follow-up period, the tumor did not relapse again, and the PRL level was also normal. RNA sequencing and DNA whole genome sequencing were performed on this prolactinoma specimen, revealing 16 possible gene mutations, including a missense mutation of the PABPC1 gene. Additionally, the copy number variation analysis results showed that several chromosomes had copy number gains compared to the matched peripheral blood sample. In this case, low expression of DRD2 and high proliferation led to resistance to CAB, whereas low MGMT expression contributed to sensitivity to TMZ treatment. The results of genome sequencing still need further investigation at the molecular level to explain the tumor aggressiveness and high sensitivity to TMZ.", "first_author": "Tang, Hao", "date_published": "2021"}, {"pmid": "33759847", "title": "Evidence for Pharmacogenomic Effects on Risperidone Outcomes in Pediatrics.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between genetic variants reported to affect risperidone and adverse events (AEs) in children and adolescents. METHODS: Individuals aged 18 years or younger with >/=4 weeks of risperidone exposure in a deidentified DNA biobank were included. The primary outcome was AE frequency as a function of genotype. Individuals were classified according to metabolizer status for CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5; wild type, heterozygote, or homozygote for specific single nucleotide variants for DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A, and HTR2C; and wild type versus nonwild type for multiple uncommon variants in ABCG2, ABCB1, and HTR2C. Tests of association of each classification to AEs were performed using a Fisher exact test and logistic regression, and statistically significant classifications were included in a final logistic regression. RESULTS: The final cohort included 257 individuals. AEs were more common in CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizers (PMs/IMs) than normal/rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers (NMs/RMs/UMs) in univariate and multivariate analysis. HTR2A-rs6311 heterozygotes and homozygotes had fewer AEs than wild types in logistic regression but not in univariate analysis.

OBJECTIVES: 1) To explore the severity of insomnia as well as sleep quality in a sample of Lebanese women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy; 2) To examine the correlation between sociodemographic, clinical, psychiatric (anxiety and depression), genetic factors, and alterations in sleep patterns. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (December 2017-June 2019; Ethical reference number: CEHDF1016). All patients gave their written consent and were genotyped for several polymorphisms in CLOCK, CRY2, PER2, COMT, DRD2, OPRM1, and ABCB1 genes using Lightcycler(R) (Roche). RESULTS: Our sample included a total of 112 women. Almost half of the patients reported insomnia problems (with 20.5% moderate insomnia and 7.1% severe insomnia). Multivariable analyses taking the PSQI score as the dependent variable, showed that higher depression score and dyslipidemia (yes versus no) were significantly associated with higher PSQI scores (worse sleep quality), whereas having the DRD2 CT genotype versus CC and a higher chemotherapy cycle number were significantly associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality). Depression was also significantly associated with higher ISI scores. When forcing all the genes in each model, the results remained the same except for depression that has been replaced by anxiety in the multivariable analysis.

In this study, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic effect of ONC201 in endometrial cancer cell lines and a genetically engineered mouse model of endometrial cancer. METHODS: Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT and colony formation assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by Cellometer. Invasion capacity was tested using adhesion, transwell and wound healing assays. LKB1(fl/fl)p53(fl/fl) mouse model of endometrial cancer were fed a control low fat diet versus a high fat diet to mimic diet-induced obesity. Following tumor onset, mice were treated with placebo or ONC201. Metabolomics and lipidomics were used to identify the obesity-dependent effects of ONC201 in the mouse endometrial tumors. DRD2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in human endometrioid and serous carcinoma specimens. DRD2 mRNA expression from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was compared between the four molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer. RESULTS: Increasing DRD2 expression in endometrial cancer was significantly associated with grade, serous histology and stage, as well as worse progression free survival and overall survival. Higher expression of DRD2 mRNA was found for the Copy Number High (CNH) subtype when compared to the other subtypes. ONC201 inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle G1 arrest, caused cellular stress and apoptosis and reduced invasion in endometrial cancer cells. Diet-induced obesity promoted endometrial tumor growth while ONC201 exhibited anti-tumorigenic efficacy in the obese and lean LKB1(fl/fl)/p53(fl/fl) mice. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that ONC201 reversed the obesity-driven upregulation of lipid biosynthesis and reduced protein biosynthesis in obese and lean mice. CONCLUSION: ONC201 has anti-tumorigenic effects in endometrial cancer cells and a transgenic mouse model of endometrial cancer, and DRD2 expression was documented in both human serous and endometrioid endometrial cancer.

Sorcs2(-/-) mice uniquely recapitulate symptoms reminiscent of ADHD in humans. Here, we show that lack of SorCS2 in mice results in lower sucrose intake, indicating general reward deficits. Using in-vivo recordings, we further find that dopaminergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is shifted towards a more regular firing pattern with marked reductions in the relative occurrence of irregular firing in Sorcs2(-/-) mice. This was paralleled by abnormal acute behavioral responses to dopamine receptor agonists, suggesting fundamental differences in dopaminergic circuits and indicating a perturbation in the balance between the activities of the postsynaptic dopamine receptor DRD1 and the presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor DRD2.

We investigated cortico-subcortical plasticity in PD using the oculomotor system as a model to study reorganization of dopaminergic networks. This model is ideal because this system reorganizes due to frontal-to-parietal shifts in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity. We tested the prediction that functional activation plasticity is associated with postsynaptic dopaminergic modifications by combining positron emission tomography/functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate striatal postsynaptic reorganization of dopamine D(2) receptors (using (11)C-raclopride) and neural activation in PD. We used covariance (connectivity) statistics at molecular and functional levels to probe striato-cortical reorganization in PD in on/off medication states to show that functional and molecular forms of reorganization are related. D(2) binding across regions defined by prosaccades showed increased molecular connectivity between both caudate/putamen and hyperactive parietal eye fields in PD in contrast with frontal eye fields in controls, in line with the shift model. Concerning antisaccades, parietal-striatal connectivity dominated in again in PD, unlike frontal regions. Concerning molecular-BOLD covariance, a striking sign reversal was observed: PD patients showed negative frontal-putamen functional-molecular associations, consistent with the reorganization shift, in contrast with the positive correlations observed in controls.

Chronic treatment with HAL led to the up-regulation of striatal DRD2 and hyperlocomotion in the rats one day after drug cessation. We thus confirmed that these rats experienced a dopamine supersensitivity state. Moreover, after repeated ES, locomotor activity and DRD2 density in the DSP model rats fell to the control level, while an ES sham operation had no effect on the dopamine supersensitivity state.

The network pharmacological strategy was used to establish the \"compound-target\" and \"disease-drug-target\" network. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed on the shared targets between the compound and the disease. Twelve algorithms on CytoHubba were used to find the hub genes that were verified by qPCR. RESULTS: Systemic administration (2 g/kg, i.p.) of ethanol (EtOH) to mice was used to induce CPP. YHZTP On its own did not induce CPP or conditioned place aversion (CPA) at the doses of 0.3 g/kg or 0.6 g/kg (i.g.), but attenuated the acquisition and expression of EtOH-induce CPP in mice. In addition, YHZTP (0.3 or 0.6 g/kg) did not exhibit any effect on the motor activity of mice. Acquisition of alcohol-induced CPP was blocked by a combination of l-THP (5 mg/kg, i.g.) + IMP (2.5 mg/kg, i.g.) or l-THP (10 mg/kg, i.g.) + IMP (5 mg/kg, i.g.). However, the combination of l-THP (2.5 mg/kg, i.g.) + IMP (1.25 mg/kg, i.g.) or mono-administration of l-THP and IMP did not exhibit any effect on alcohol-induced CPP.

ONC201 appears to act as a selective antagonist of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), and as an allosteric agonist of mitochondrial protease caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Downstream of target engagement, ONC201 activates the ATF4/CHOP-mediated integrated stress response leading to TRAIL/Death Receptor 5 (DR5) activation, inhibits oxidative phosphorylation via c-myc, and inactivates Akt/ERK signaling in tumor cells. This typically results in DR5/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells; however, DR5/TRAIL-independent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or antiproliferative effects also occur. The effects of ONC201 extend beyond bulk tumor cells to include cancer stem cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment that can contribute to its efficacy. ONC201 is orally administered, crosses the intact blood brain barrier, and is under evaluation in clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies. ONC201 has single agent clinical activity in tumor types that are enriched for DRD2 and/or ClpP expression including specific subtypes of high-grade glioma, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, and adrenal tumors. Synergy with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint agents has been identified in preclinical models and is being evaluated in clinical trials. Structure-activity relationships based on the core pharmacophore of ONC201, termed the imipridone scaffold, revealed novel potent compounds that are being developed.

METHODS: This open-label, phase II study enrolled 18 Japanese outpatients (20 to <65 years) with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria; total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score <120 at screening) treated with blonanserin 8-mg or 16-mg tablets. Patients continued tablets for 2-4 weeks at their current dose and were then assigned to once-daily blonanserin patches (10/20/40/60/80 mg daily) for 2-4 weeks based on the oral dose. [11C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning determined blonanserin striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included assessment of receptor occupancy by dose, changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness-Severity scores, patient attitudes towards adherence, and patch adhesiveness. RESULTS: Of 18 patients who started the blonanserin tablet treatment period, 14 patients completed treatment. Mean D2 receptor occupancy for blonanserin tablets 8 mg/d (59.2%, n = 5) and 16 mg/d (66.3%, n = 9) was within the values for blonanserin patches: 10 mg/d (33.3%, n = 3), 20 mg/d (29.9%, n = 2), 40 mg/d (61.2%, n = 3), 60 mg/d (59.0%, n = 3), and 80 mg/d (69.9%, n = 3). Occupancy generally increased with increasing blonanserin dose for both formulations with the half maximal receptor occupancy for tablets and patches associated with doses of 6.9 mg/d and 31.9 mg/d, respectively. Diurnal variability in occupancy was lower during transdermal patch treatment than during tablet treatment. Blonanserin transdermal patches were well tolerated with no major safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Blonanserin patches (40/80 mg/d) have lower diurnal variability in occupancy than blonanserin tablets (8/16 mg/d), and patches at doses of 40 mg/d and 80 mg/d appear to be a suitable alternative for blonanserin tablets at doses of 8 mg/d and 16 mg/d, respectively.

The upregulation of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) provoked by antipsychotics underlies DSP. Aripiprazole does not cause an excessive blockade of DRD2 and is less likely to upregulate DRD2 by aripiprazole's dopamine partial agonistic profile. Aripiprazole; however, has a potential risk of inducing severe rebound psychosis in patients who have already developed dopamine supersensitivity. Recently, an animal model study suggested that aripiprazole could attenuate established dopamine supersensitivity. The present study was conducted to examine whether very slowly switching to aripiprazole could help patients with schizophrenia with dopamine supersensitivity while avoiding rebound psychosis. This study was a single-armed and open-labeled study in which patients were observed over a period of 2 years. Only 11 patients were ultimately recruited.

Here we examine potential molecular determinants of this efficacy. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma database and other published mRNA profiles were used to analyze the DRD2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression pattern. In vitro and in vivo responses to DRD2 inhibitors were determined using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) glioblastoma models. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on clinically annotated glioblastoma samples derived from patients treated with ONC201. RESULTS: Analysis of clinical glioblastoma specimens derived from independent patient cohorts revealed an inverse correlation between EGFR and DRD2 mRNA expression, with implication that signaling mediated by these proteins shares overlapping functions. In independent panels of PDX glioblastoma lines, high EGFR expression was associated with poor in vitro and in vivo response to DRD2 inhibitors, including haloperidol and ONC201. Moreover, ectopic expression of a constitutively active EGFR, variant (v)III, suppressed glioblastoma sensitivity to ONC201. DRD2 expression positively correlated with expression of rate-limiting enzymes for dopamine synthesis as well as dopamine secretion, suggesting contribution of autocrine DRD2 signaling. Analysis of specimens from patients treated with ONC201 (n = 15) showed an inverse correlation between the intensity of EGFR staining and clinical response.

Two main cerebral areas are responsible for controlling feeding through hunger and food reward: the hypothalamus (HPT) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), respectively. The dopaminergic system modulates both these areas and is essential to control food ingestion. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the effects of restrictive and hyperlipidic diets during pregnancy, lactation and during adult life of the offspring, on the expression of dopaminergic system genes in VTA and HPT of mice dams and their adult male offspring. We also measured diets' effect in locomotor activity in the open field (OF) test. Female mice were divided into control (CONT), restriction (RD) and hyperlipidic (HD) dietary groups, and mated with isogenic male mice. On the 9th postpartum day (PPD), dams were tested in the OF, and on the 22nd PPD cerebral areas were collected. After weaning, the offspring also were divided into one of three diet groups, independently of the diets provided to their dams. In the 80th PPD, the offspring was tested in the OF, and at 100th PPD, VTA and HPT were collected. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between gene expression and locomotor activity was also assessed. In dams' VTA, both diets upregulated the expression of Th, Slc6a3/Dat1, Drd1 and Drd2 genes. In opposition, in the offspring the maternal diet was associated with a reduction in Th and Ddc gene expression. In the HPT, mice dams that received restriction or hyperlipidic diets had increased Th mRNA levels, but reduced the expression of Drd4 gene. The offspring diet had no effect on the expression of the studied genes in their adult lives. Both diets increased mice dam's locomotion in the OF, however none of them altered the offspring locomotor activity. We detected a positive correlation between the duration of total locomotion in the OF and Slc6a3/Dat1 gene expression in VTA of mice dams. In the HPT, a negative correlation of locomotion and Drd4 mRNA levels, and a positive correlation with Th gene expression was observed.

Dopamine agonists (DAs), such as cabergoline (CAB), have been successfully used in the treatment of prolactinomas. The expression of dopamine type 2 receptor (DRD2) determines the therapeutic effect of DAs, but the molecular mechanisms of DRD2 regulation are not fully understood. In this study, we first demonstrated that DRD2 underwent proteasome-mediated degradation. We further employed the yeast two-hybrid system and identified kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 7 (KBTBD7), a substrate adaptor for the CUL3-RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex, as a DRD2-interacting protein. KBTBD6/7 directly interacted with, and ubiquitinated DRD2 at five ubiquitination sites (K221, K226, K241, K251, and K258). CAB, a high-affinity DRD2 agonist, induced DRD2 internalization, and cytoplasmic DRD2 was degraded via ubiquitination under the control of KBTBD6/7, the activity of which attenuated CAB-mediated inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway. KBTBD7 knockout (KO) mice were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, in which the static level of DRD2 protein was elevated in the pituitary gland, thalamus, and heart, compared to that of WT mice. Consistently, the expression of KBTBD6/7 was negatively correlated with that of DRD2 in human pituitary tumors. Moreover, KBTBD7 was highly expressed in dopamine-resistant prolactinomas, but at low levels in dopamine-sensitive prolactinomas. Knockdown of KBTBD6/7 sensitized MMQ cells and primary pituitary tumor cells to CAB treatment. Conversely, KBTBD7 overexpression increased CAB resistance of estrogen-induced in situ rat prolactinoma model. Together, our findings have uncovered the novel mechanism of DRD2 protein degradation and shown that the KBTBD6/7-DRD2 axis regulates PA sensitivity to DA treatment.

Dopamine agonists stimulate the dopamine D2 receptor, resulting in a decrease in prolactin (PRL) levels and in prolactinoma size but action on dopamine receptors in the meso-limbic system may rarely cause psychosis and more commonly cause impulse control disorders. The psychiatric benefits of antipsychotic agents involve blocking the D2 and other dopamine receptors but this blockade often also causes hyperprolactinemia. In patients with macroprolactinomas and psychosis, observation, estrogen/progestin replacement, and surgery can be considered in addition to dopamine agonists. In those who require dopamine agonists for PRL and tumor size control, the introduction of antipsychotics may blunt this effect, so that higher doses of the dopamine agonists may be needed. Alternatively, antipsychotics that have less of a blocking effect at the D2 receptor, such as aripiprazole, can be tried, if appropriate. For patients already on antipsychotic drugs who are found to have a macroprolactinoma for which dopamine agonists are required, dopamine agonists can be initiated at low dose and the dose escalated slowly. However, such patients require careful monitoring of psychiatric status to avoid the rare complication of exacerbation of the underlying psychosis.

RESULTS: Of 48 identified research articles, 29 assessed differences in outcomes without inclusion of genetic variation and 20 explored effects of genetic variation; of note: one article included both types of data. Analysis of the 29 papers with clinical outcomes only suggests that while data on efficacy and risk of movement disorders were heterogeneous, findings indicate increased risk of metabolic effects and neutropenia among Blacks. Of the 20 articles exploring effects of genetic variation, allelic or genotypic variations involving several genes were associated with altered efficacy or safety among Blacks but not Whites, including risk of decreased response involving variation in DRD4 and DRD1, and improved efficacy associated with variants in DRD2, COMT, and RGS4.

METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers receiving 5 oral doses of 10 mg aripiprazole and 5 mg olanzapine tablets were genotyped for 46 polymorphisms by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Pupil examination was performed by automated pupillometry. Aripiprazole, dehydro-aripiprazole and olanzapine plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Aripiprazole affected pupil contraction: it caused dilatation after the administration of the first dose, then caused constriction after each dosing. It induced changes in all pupillometric parameters (P < .05). Olanzapine only altered minimum pupil size (P = .046). Polymorphisms in CYP3A, HTR2A, UGT1A1, DRD2 and ABCB1 affected pupil size, the time of onset of constriction, pupil recovery and constriction velocity.

In contrast to aripiprazole, brexpiprazole has lower intrinsic dopamine D2 activity and higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, while cariprazine has the highest affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor, and the longest half-life. The main adverse effect of dopamine receptor partial agonists (DRPAs) is akathisia of low-to-moderate severity, which occurs in a small proportion of patients, usually in the first few weeks of treatment. While definitive conclusions concerning differences between the DRPAs require head-to-head comparison studies, on the available evidence, akathisia is probably least likely to occur with brexpiprazole and most likely with cariprazine; the risk of akathisia with aripiprazole lies in between. Weight-gain risk is low with aripiprazole and cariprazine, but moderate with brexpiprazole. Risk of sedation is low with DRPAs, as is risk of insomnia and nausea. Partial dopamine agonism leads to a low risk for hyperprolactinaemia (and probably a low risk of sexual dysfunction). Prolactin concentrations fall in some patients (particularly those with elevated levels prior to initiating the drugs). Rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects in pivotal studies were low, and on the whole, DRPAs are well tolerated.

Thus, it is important to capture the association between striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (D2-RO) and global subjective well-being. We examined this association using data from our multicenter, randomized, double-blind Neuroleptic Strategy Study (NeSSy). METHODS: An innovative double randomization process was used for allocation of patients to the specific treatment groups. Plasma drug concentrations were measured after 6 and 24 weeks of treatment to obtain the estimated D2-RO (eD2-RO) relative to literature values. We made an exploratory analysis of associations between eD2-RO and subjective well-being scores. One hundred two blood samples from 69 patients were available for the analysis. Because of the lack of a satisfactory occupancy model for quetiapine, only haloperidol, flupentixol, and olanzapine treatment groups were pooled, whereas aripiprazole data were analyzed separately, because of its partial agonistic properties. RESULTS: In the pooled antagonist group, eD2-RO correlated negatively with the summarized well-being score. In a more detailed analysis, this association could be confirmed for all first-generation antipsychotic-treated patients, but not for the separate second-generation antipsychotic groups. In the aripiprazole group, higher eD2-RO was associated with impaired physical well-being, but had no association with mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high plasma levels and consequently high occupancy at D2 receptors are disadvantageous for subjective well-being, as distinct from the objective extrapyramidal side effects. To minimize patients' malaise, which disfavors adherence, implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring in the clinical routine may be useful.", "first_author": "Veselinovic, Tanja", "date_published": "2019 November/December"}, {"pmid": "31682820", "title": "Epigenetic Dysregulation of Dopaminergic System by Maternal Cafeteria Diet During Early Postnatal Development.", "abstract": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter crucial for motor, motivational, and reward-related functions. Our aim was to determine the effect of a palatable maternal diet on the transcriptional regulation of dopaminergic-related genes during perinatal development of rat offspring. For that, female offspring from dams fed with a control (CON) or a cafeteria (CAF) diet were sacrificed on embryonic day 21 (E21) and postnatal day 10 (PND10). Using micropunch techniques, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) were isolated from brain's offspring. Bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions, mRNA quantification and methylation studies were done. The increase in tyroxine hidroxylase (TH), dopamine receptor (DRD) 1 and ghrelin receptor (GHSR) expression in VTA and NAc from E21 to PND10 was correlated with changes in DNA methylation of their promoter regions. Maternal diet did not affect the expressionpatternsin E21. At PND10, maternal CAF diet decreased the transcription of TH, GHSR, DRD2 and dopamine transporter (DAT) in VTA. Interestingly, the changes in TH, DRD2 and DAT expression were related to the methylation status of their promoters. In NAc, maternal CAF diet reduced DRD1, DRD2 and DAT expression in the offspring at PND10, although alternations in the methylation patterns were only detected in DAT promoter. These results show the importance of maternal nutrition and provide novel insights into the mechanisms through which maternal junk-food feeding can affect reward system during development and early postnatal life.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is the key region of the brain reward system and predominantly consists of two subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) based on the expression of D1 or D2 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs). Spine structural plasticity in the NAc is critical for the acquisition, reconsolidation and extinction of drug-associated memory. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying METH-associated memory and spine remodelling in each type of MSNs in the NAc remain unknown. Here, we explored whether Rac1 in the NAc mediates METH-associated contextual memory and spine remodelling. Methods: Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of Rac1 were used to investigate its role during the acquisition, reconsolidation and extinction of METH-associated contextual memory. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses expressing mCherry under the control of the dopamine D1 receptor gene promoter (Drd1-mCherry) or dopamine D2 receptor gene promoter (Drd2-mCherry) were used to specifically label D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs. Results: Using viral-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrated that decreased Rac1 activity was required for the acquisition of METH-associated contextual memory and the METH-induced increase in thin spine density, whereas increased Rac1 signalling was important for the extinction of METH-associated contextual memory and the related elimination of thin spines. Moreover, the increase of dendritic spines was both found in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs during the acquisition process, but extinction training selectively decreased the spine density in D1-MSNs. Interestingly, Rac1 was responsible for METH-induced spine plasticity in D1-MSNs but not in D2-MSNs. Additionally, we found that microinjection of a Rac1 inhibitor or activator into the NAc was not sufficient to disrupt reconsolidation, and the pharmacological activation of Rac1 in the NAc facilitated the extinction of METH-associated contextual memory. Regarding cognitive memory, decreased Rac1 activity improved the METH-induced impairment in object recognition memory. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that Rac1 plays opposing roles in the acquisition and extinction of METH-associated contextual memory and reveal the cell-specific role of Rac1 in METH-associated spine remodelling, suggesting that Rac1 is a potential therapeutic target for reducing relapse in METH addiction and remediating METH-induced recognition memory impairment.", "first_author": "Zhao, Jinlan", "date_published": "2019"}, {"pmid": "31557839", "title": "Clinical and Genetic Factors Associated with Resistance to Treatment in Patients with Schizophrenia: A Case-Control Study.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess clinical and genetic factors affecting response to treatment in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (treatment-resistant patients versus treatment responders).

Therefore, in this study, we comprehensively investigate the molecular recognition and differential binding landscapes of class-I and II DRD2 atypical antipsychotics, using membrane-bilayer molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy techniques. Findings revealed that selected class-I antipsychotics exhibited binding dynamics and poses dissimilar to the class-II types with different interactive mechanisms at the binding cavity of DRD2. More interestingly, the class-II drugs established a highly coordinated binding at the DRD2 active site with a pertinent and recurrent involvement of Asp114 via strong hydrogen interactions.

Exposure of microglia to cocaine also resulted in increased expression of DNM1L and OPTN with a concomitant decrease in the rate of mitochondrial oxygen consumption as well as impaired mitochondrial functioning. Additionally, in the presence of cocaine, microglia also exhibited upregulated expression of autophagosome markers, BECN1, MAP1LC3B-II, and SQSTM1. Taken together, these findings suggested diminished mitophagy flux and accumulation of mitophagosomes in the presence of cocaine. These findings were further confirmed by imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Cocaine-mediated activation of microglia was further monitored by assessing the expression of the microglial marker (ITGAM) and the inflammatory cytokine (Tnf, Il1b, and Il6) mRNAs. Pharmacological, as well as gene-silencing approaches aimed at blocking both the autophagy/mitophagy and SIGMAR1 expression, underscored the role of impaired mitophagy in cocaine-mediated activation of microglia. Furthermore, superoxide dismutase mimetics such as TEMPOL and MitoTEMPO were shown to alleviate cocaine-mediated impaired mitophagy as well as microglial activation.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Deltapsim: mitochondrial membrane potential; ACTB: actin, beta; AIF1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BAF: bafilomycin A(1); BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CNS: central nervous system; DNM1L: dynamin 1 like; DMEM: Dulbecco modified Eagle medium; DAPI: 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole; DRD2: dopamine receptor D2; ECAR: extracellular acidification rate; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FCCP: Trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IL1B: interleukin 1, beta; IL6: interleukin 6; ITGAM: integrin subunit alpha M; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; mPMs: mouse primary microglial cells; MRC: maximal respiratory capacity; NFKB: nuclear factor kappa B; NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; NTRK2: neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; OPTN: optineurin; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.", "first_author": "Thangaraj, Annadurai", "date_published": "2020 February"}, {"pmid": "30967134", "title": "A pharmacogenetic study of patients with schizophrenia from West Siberia gets insight into dopaminergic mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) is a classical side effect of antipsychotic drugs primarily attributed to blockade of dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2s) on the membranes of lactotroph cells within the pituitary gland. Certain antipsychotic drugs, e.g. risperidone, are more likely to induce HPRL because of relative accumulation within the adenohypophysis. Nevertheless, due to competition for pituitary DRD2s by high dopamine levels may limit antipsychotic-induced HPRL. Moreover, the activity of prolactin-producing lactotrophs also depends on other hormones which are regulated by the extra-pituitary activity of dopamine receptors, dopamine transporters, enzymes of neurotransmitter metabolism and other factors. Polymorphic variants in the genes coding for these receptors and proteins can have functional significance and influence on the development of hyperprolactinemia. METHODS: A set of 41 SNPs of genes for dopamine receptors DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 and dopamine catabolizing enzymes MAOA and MAOB was investigated in a population of 446 Caucasians (221 males/225 females) with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (according to ICD-10: F20) with and without HPRL who were treated with classical and/or atypical antipsychotic drugs. Additive genetic model was tested and the analysis was carried out in the total group and in subgroup stratified by the use of risperidone/paliperidone. RESULTS: One statistically significant association between polymorphic variant rs1799836 of MAOB gene and HPRL in men was found in the total group. Furthermore, the rs40184 and rs3863145 variants in SLC6A3 gene appeared to be associated with HPRL in the subgroup of patients using the risperidone/paliperidone, but not with HPRL induced by other antipsychotic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that genetic variants of MAOB and SLC6A3 may have consequences on the modulation of prolactin secretion.

Neostriatal dopamine receptors play a role in MA monoamine neurotoxicity. Blocking dopamine receptors prior to MA exposure in adult rats attenuates monoamine reductions and reactive gliosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested whether blocking dopamine receptors protects against cognitive deficits. METHODS: First, we determined the effects of MA alone versus MA in combination with the dopamine receptor D1 antagonist SCH-23390 or the dopamine receptor D2 antagonist sulpiride on cFos expression and monoamines at the age when rats in the cognitive experiment were to begin testing and monoamines in rats after cognitive testing. RESULTS: SCH-23390 infused into the neostriatum prior to systemic administration of MA attenuated MA-induced cFos activation while sulpiride induced cFos activation. Two weeks after MA, rats had dopamine and serotonin reductions that were attenuated by each antagonist. Other rats treated the same way, were tested for egocentric learning and memory in the Cincinnati water maze, for navigational strategy in a star water maze, and spatial learning and memory in a Morris water maze. Pre-treatment with SCH-23390 or sulpiride attenuated the effects of MA on egocentric and spatial learning and memory. MA-treated rats showed a shift from an egocentric to a disorganized strategy in the star maze that was less disorganized in groups receiving MA and an antagonist. Post-behavior monoamine reductions remained but were attenuated by the antagonists but not identically to what was seen in rats not behaviorally tested.

DRD5 is a dopamine receptor family member that opposes DRD2 signaling. We investigated the expression of these dopamine receptors in cancer and their influence on tumor cell sensitivity to ONC201. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to determine DRD2/DRD5 expression broadly across human cancers. Cell viability assays were performed with ONC201 in >1,000 Genomic of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and NCI60 cell lines. IHC staining of DRD2/DRD5 was performed on tissue microarrays and archival tumor tissues of glioblastoma patients treated with ONC201. Whole exome sequencing was performed in RKO cells with and without acquired ONC201 resistance. Wild-type and mutant DRD5 constructs were generated for overexpression studies. RESULTS: DRD2 overexpression broadly occurs across tumor types and is associated with a poor prognosis. Whole exome sequencing of cancer cells with acquired resistance to ONC201 revealed a de novo Q366R mutation in the DRD5 gene. Expression of Q366R DRD5 was sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis, consistent with a gain-of-function. DRD5 overexpression in glioblastoma cells enhanced DRD2/DRD5 heterodimers and DRD5 expression was inversely correlated with innate tumor cell sensitivity to ONC201. Investigation of archival tumor samples from patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with ONC201 revealed that low DRD5 expression was associated with relatively superior clinical outcomes.

Our data revealed that rats express a strong preference for 1% sucrose, and showed increased mu-opioid receptor mRNA expression bilaterally in the nucleus accumbens; increased D1 receptor mRNA expression in the left nucleus accumbens; and increased D2 receptor mRNA expression and decreased D2 receptor protein expression in the right nucleus accumbens. We also noted clear individual differences in the volumes of sucrose ingested over this period, however these differences did not correlate with the changes in neurochemistry.

One of the possible pathogeneses of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (Ai-DSP). Patients with this disease progression might share some genetic vulnerabilities, and thus determining individuals with higher risks of developing Ai-DSP could contribute to preventing iatrogenic development of TRS. Therefore, we decided to examine whether combinations of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to affect dopaminergic functions are related to Ai-DSP development. METHODS: In this case-control study, 357 Japanese participants diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited and divided into two groups, those with and without Ai-DSP. As functional SNPs, we examined rs10770141 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, and rs1799732 and rs1800497 of the DRD2 genes, which are known to possess strong directional ties to dopamine synthesis, dopamine degradation and post-synaptic DRD2 prevalence, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 357 Japanese patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 130 were classified as Ai-DSP(+) and the other 227 as Ai-DSP(-). Significantly higher proportions of Ai-DSP(+) patients were found to have the SNP combinations of rs10770141/rs4680 (57.9%, OR2.654, 95%CI1.036-6.787, P = 0.048) and rs10770141/rs4680/ rs1800497 (64.3%, OR4.230, 95%CI1.306-13.619, P = 0.029).

AIMS: Our aim was to evaluate if aripiprazole affects pupil contraction and its relationship with pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics. METHODS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers receiving a 10 mg single oral dose of aripiprazole were genotyped for 15 polymorphisms in ABCB1, CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A and HTR2C genes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

METHODS: A school-based cross-sectional study design was applied. A total of 323 children (2014-2015, 7-12 years old) were enrolled from four schools in both historical endemic and non-endemic areas of fluorosis in Tianjin of China using a cluster sampling method. Urine fluoride levels and age-specific IQ scores in children were measured at the enrollment. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were used to genotype DRD2 Taq 1A polymorphism with genomic DNA isolated from whole blood collected at the enrollment. Multiple linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between urine fluoride levels and IQ scores overall and within the DRD2 Taq 1A SNP = CC/CT and TT subgroups.

AIM AND METHODS: We investigated the influence of estimated D(2)R (Est.D(2)R) occupancy by antipsychotics on the relationships between IIA and illness severity, and IIA and cognition. IIA was assessed in 373 adult patients with schizophrenia (18-62 years) using data from CATIE. IIA was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item G12.

METHODS: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant cohort or case-control studies published before 9 May 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the relationship between the dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 (DRD1, 2, and 3) and the effect of risperidone treatment. The summary odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) in a random-effects model were used to measure these relationships. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 24 SNPs were included. DRD2 (Ser311Cys, rs1801028 Ser/Ser) significantly lowered the improvement rate (determined by the PANSS score) unlike Ser/Cys (WMD: -11.58, 95% CI: -17.35 to -5.18).

Glutamatergic synapses in the core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) undergo transient potentiation in response to presenting drug-associated cues. The NAcore contains two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that differentially express D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. By recording the ratio of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor currents (AMPA/NMDA ratio) from MSNs in NAcore tissue slices, we endeavored to understand which subpopulation of MSNs was undergoing transient potentiation. Transgenic female and male mice differentially expressing fluorescent reporters in D1 or D2 MSNs were withdrawn for 2-3 weeks after being trained to self-administer cocaine. In some mice, discrete cocaine-conditioned cues were isolated from the drug-associated context via extinction training, which causes rodents to refrain from drug seeking in the extinguished context. By measuring AMPA/NMDA ratios in the drug context with or without contextual or discrete cues, and with or without extinction training, we made the following three discoveries: (1) mice refraining from cocaine seeking in the extinguished context showed selective elevation in AMPA/NMDA ratios in D2 MSNs; (2) without extinction training, the drug-associated context selectively increased AMPA/NMDA ratios in D1 MSNs; (3) mice undergoing cue-induced cocaine seeking after extinction training in the drug-associated context showed AMPA/NMDA ratio increases in both D1 and D2 MSNs. These findings reveal that the NAcore codes drug seeking through transient potentiation of D1 MSNs, and that refraining from cocaine seeking in an extinguished context is coded through transient potentiation of D2 MSNs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Relapse is a primary symptom of addiction that can involve competition between the desire to use drugs and the desire to refrain from using drugs.

METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with PD were genotyped for known functional polymorphisms in DRD2 (rs6277 and rs1800497) and DRD3 (rs6280) receptors. These patients then completed the Simon conflict task both on and off DAAg therapy in a counterbalanced manner. RESULTS: We found that patients with the rs1800497 Taq1A (A1) polymorphism (A1/A1 or A1/A2: 11 subjects) showed improved proficiency to suppress impulsive actions when on DAAg; conversely, patients with the A2/A2 allele (14 patients) became less proficient at suppressing incorrect response information on DAAg therapy (Group x Medication, F(1, 23) = 5.65, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms in rs6277 and rs6280 were not associated with a differential medication response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that certain DRD polymorphisms may determine the direction of DAAg effects on critical cognitive control processes impaired in PD.

Both their therapeutic and adverse effects display significant interindividual variation, partially attributable to genetic factors. We have previously isolated a seven-gene region of rat chromosome 8 sensitizing to dexamethasone (DEX)-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR) of skeletal muscle. Using two newly derived congenic strains, we aimed to investigate the effect of one of the prime candidates for this pharmacogenetic interaction, the Zbtb16 gene. METHODS: Adult male rats of SHR-Lx.PD5(PD-)(Zbtb16) (n = 9) and SHR-Lx.PD5(SHR-)(Zbtb16) (n = 8) were fed standard diet (STD) and subsequently treated with DEX in drinking water (2.6 microg/ml) for 3 days. The morphometric and metabolic profiles of both strains including oral glucose tolerance test, triacylglycerols (TGs), free fatty acids, insulin, and C-reactive protein levels were assessed before and after the DEX treatment. Insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue was determined by incorporation of radioactively labeled glucose. RESULTS: The differential segment of SHR-Lx.PD5(SHR-)(Zbtb16) rat strain spans 563 kb and contains six genes: Htr3a, Htr3b, Usp28, Zw10, Tmprss5, and part of Drd2. The SHR-Lx.PD5(PD-)(Zbtb16) minimal congenic strain contains only Zbtb16 gene on SHR genomic background and its differential segment spans 254 kb. Total body weight was significantly increased in SHR-Lx.PD5(PD-)(Zbtb16) strain compared with SHR-Lx.PD5(SHR-)(Zbtb16) , however, no differences in the weights of adipose tissue depots were observed. While STD-fed rats of both strains did not show major differences in their metabolic profiles, after DEX treatment the SHR-Lx.PD5(PD-)(Zbtb16) congenic strain showed increased levels of TGs, glucose, and blunted inhibition of lipolysis by insulin. Both basal and insulin-stimulated incorporation of radioactively labeled glucose into skeletal muscle glycogen were significantly reduced in SHR-Lx.PD5(PD-)(Zbtb16) strain, but the insulin sensitivity of adipose tissue was comparable between the two strains.

Therefore, to assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds, we analyzed results from multiple trials of dopamine receptor agonists in patients with idiopathic dystonias and also tested the efficacy of dopamine receptor agonists in a mouse model of generalized dystonia. Our results suggest that dopamine receptor agonists were effective in some, but not all, patients tested.

However, rigorously controlled trials are still needed. In a mouse model of dystonia, a selective D1 dopamine receptor agonist was not effective while a selective D2 dopamine receptor had modest efficacy. However, when combined, these receptor-selective agonists acted synergistically to ameliorate the dystonia.

Thus, results from both clinical trials and tests in mice suggest that coactivation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors may be an effective therapeutic strategy in some patients.

RESULTS: From 37 candidate studies on levodopa toxicity, 18 genes were found associated, of which, CA(n) STR 13, 14 (DRD2) was most significantly associated with dyskinesia, followed by rs1801133 (MTHFR) with hyper-homocysteinemia, and rs474559 (HOMER1) with hallucination. Similarly, 8 studies on efficacy resulted in 4 genes in which rs28363170, rs3836790 (SLC6A3) and rs4680 (COMT), were significant. To establish the molecular connection between LR with PD, we identified 35 genes significantly associated with PD. With 19 proteins associated with LR and 35 with PD, two independent PPI networks were constructed. Among the 67 nodes (263 edges) in LR, and 62 nodes (190 edges) in PD pathophysiology, UBC, SNCA, FYN, SRC, CAMK2A, and SLC6A3 were identified as common potential candidates. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the genetically significant polymorphism concerning the ADRs and levodopa efficacy.

It was recently demonstrated that DSP can have a negative impact on the long-term prognosis of schizophrenia patients and that DSP could be involved in the etiology of some cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Utilizing pharmacogenetic information may be helpful in assessing unique responses to therapy. We report herein a case of wearing-off phenomena during treatment with aripiprazole long-acting injectable (LAI) and a proof of concept strategy of how pharmacogenetic information may be used to assess possible genetic factors and also hypothesize potential mechanisms for further study. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old African American male with schizoaffective disorder was referred to a psychiatric clinic for medication management. After unsuccessful trials of multiple antipsychotics, oral aripiprazole was initiated (up to 30 mg/day) and transitioned to aripiprazole LAI with symptom improvement. At a high dose of aripiprazole LAI (400 mg Q3wks), the patient experienced breakthrough symptoms approximately 3 days prior to his next injection. Various considerations were examined to explain his atypical dose requirements, including but not limited to pharmacogenetic influences. Pharmacogenetic testing ruled out genetic influences on drug metabolism but noted a -141C Del variant in the dopamine-D2 receptor (DRD2) gene associated in prior studies of poor-response to antipsychotics. At this time, a new formulation, aripiprazole lauroxil, was explored due to its availability in higher dose options. Transition to the new formulation (882 mg Q4wks) greatly improved and stabilized the patient's symptoms with no breakthrough psychosis. Comparable daily dose equivalents were achieved with two different formulations due to the Q3wks vs Q4wks dosing strategies, although the two agents have some differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of a patient experiencing wearing-off symptoms with aripiprazole LAI who benefited from switching to aripiprazole lauroxil. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed normal activity for relevant metabolism pathways but a DRD2 -141C variant that may influence brain D2 expression and antipsychotic responsiveness. The clinical utility of DRD2 information and what to do with genotyping results has not been previously addressed, despite availability on clinical test panels.

Fifteen recently abstinent methamphetamine users and 15 healthy controls completed two laboratory paradigms of 'simulated' drug choice (choice for drug-related vs affectively pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images), and underwent positron emission tomography measurements of dopamine D2-type receptor availability, indicated by binding potential (BP(ND)) for [(18)F]fallypride. Thirteen of the methamphetamine users and 10 controls also underwent [(11)C]NNC112 PET scans to measure dopamine D1-type receptor availability.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP1), and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2). CONCLUSIONS: TDA identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in TBI patients.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to AMPH can induce damage to nerve terminals of dopamine (DA) neurons. We here assessed the underlying neurobiological changes in the DA system following repeated AMPH exposure and pre-treated rats with AMPH or saline (4 times 5 mg/kg s.c., 2 hours apart), followed by a 1-week washout period. We then used pharmacological MRI (phMRI) with a methylphenidate (MPH) challenge, as a sensitive and non-invasive in-vivo measure of DAergic function. We subsequently validated the DA-ergic changes post-mortem, using a.o. high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and autoradiography. In the AMPH pre-treated group, we observed a significantly larger BOLD response to the MPH challenge, particularly in DA-ergic brain areas and their downstream projections. Subsequent autoradiography studies showed that AMPH pre-treatment significantly reduced DA transporter (DAT) density in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens, whereas HPLC analysis revealed increases in the DA metabolite homovanillic acid in the CPu. Our results suggest that AMPH pre-treatment alters DAergic responsivity, a change that can be detected with phMRI in rats. These phMRI changes likely reflect increased DA release together with reduced DAT binding. The ability to assess subtle synaptic changes using phMRI is promising for both preclinical studies of drug discovery, and for clinical studies where phMRI can be a useful tool to non-invasively investigate DA abnormalities, e.g. in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "first_author": "Schrantee, Anouk", "date_published": "2017"}, {"pmid": "28228056", "title": "Brexpiprazole.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology and clinical data for brexpiprazole in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD).

All articles containing human clinical trial data published up to September 2016 were evaluated for inclusion as well as information from the manufacturer's product labeling. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Phase 3 trials for brexpiprazole were evaluated. Key in vitro and animal data were incorporated into the pharmacology and pharmacokinetic sections where appropriate. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four phase 3 trials have evaluated the use of brexpiprazole as a primary therapy for schizophrenia or as an antidepressant adjunct for MDD. For its schizophrenia indication, brexpiprazole was studied in 2 placebo-controlled trials of approximately 1300 patients, with 4 mg of brexpiprazole consistently showing superiority over placebo. For MDD, brexpiprazole was compared with placebo as an adjunct to antidepressants in approximately 1000 patients who had failed trials of 1 to 3 prior antidepressants. The 2-mg and 3-mg dosages of brexpiprazole showed consistent superiority over placebo in the MDD trials. Common treatment emergent adverse effects included akathisia and weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Brexpiprazole showed efficacy for the treatment of schizophrenia in the range of 2 to 4 mg/d and as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in MDD when dosed at 2 to 3 mg/d.

We hypothesized that co-expression pathways of SCZ risk genes are associated with system-level brain function and clinical phenotypes of SCZ. We examined genetic variants related to the dopamine D2 receptor gene DRD2 co-expression pathway and associated them with working memory (WM) behavior, the related brain activity and treatment response. Using two independent post-mortem prefrontal messenger RNA (mRNA) data sets (total N=249), we identified a DRD2 co-expression pathway enriched for SCZ risk genes. Next, we identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with co-expression of this pathway. These SNPs were associated with regulatory genetic loci in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P<0.05). We summarized their compound effect on co-expression into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI), which predicted DRD2 pathway co-expression in both mRNA data sets (all P<0.05). We associated the PCI with brain activity during WM performance in two independent samples of healthy individuals (total N=368) and 29 patients with SCZ who performed the n-back task. Greater predicted DRD2 pathway prefrontal co-expression was associated with greater prefrontal activity and longer WM reaction times (all corrected P<0.05), thus indicating inefficient WM processing.

Data were taken from a positron emission tomography (PET) study conducted between August 2007 and August 2015. The present post hoc study included 42 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) (mean +/- SD age = 60.2 +/- 6.7 years) taking olanzapine or risperidone. Subjects underwent [(1)(1)C]-raclopride PET scans to measure D2/3R occupancy before and after reducing their dose of antipsychotic by up to 40%. Blood samples were collected before each PET scan to measure prolactin levels. METHODS: The relationship between prolactin levels and D2/3R occupancy was examined using stepwise linear regression analyses. The D2/3R occupancy thresholds for hyperprolactinemia were explored using Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Prolactin levels decreased following dose reduction (mean +/- SD = 24.1 +/- 30.2 ng/mL to 17.2 +/- 15.1 ng/mL; P < .001). Prolactin levels were associated with female gender (beta = .32, P = .006, vs male), antipsychotics (beta = .23, P = .02, risperidone vs olanzapine), and D2/3R occupancy (beta = .23, P = .04). Those with D2/3R occupancy of 66% or higher were more likely to have hyperprolactinemia than those with D2/3R occupancy lower than 66% (P = .03). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of this threshold were 0.44, 0.81, 0.78, and 0.48, respectively. We identified a D2/3R occupancy threshold for hyperprolactinemia of 66% in older patients with schizophrenia, which is lower than that reported in younger patients (73%) by other researchers.

Schizophrenia pathology is introduced using quantitative human imaging data on striatal hyperdopaminergic activity and cortical dysfunction.

Previous studies have suggested that the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) acts as a key target in regulating the neuroinflammatory response. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, and effective DRD2 agonists are lacking. In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of sinomenine (Sino), a monomeric compound with potential immunoregulatory properties in nervous system. METHODS: TTC staining, apoptosis assay, evaluation of brain edema, and neurological assessment were performed in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model. Primary astrocytes exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were used in the in vitro experiments. Quantitative PCR was applied to assess the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Multi-labeling immunofluorescence, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were also used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the Sino-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Sino remarkably attenuated the cerebral infarction and neuronal apoptosis, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and alleviated neurological deficiency in MCAO mice. Sino significantly inhibited astrocytic activation and STAT3 phosphorylation as well as increased DRD2 and alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) expression after MCAO. In vitro, Sino blocked OGD-induced activation of STAT3 and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary astrocytes, and these effects were significantly abolished by either DRD2 or CRYAB knockdown. Additionally, Sino induced up-regulation and nuclear translocation of CRYAB in astrocytes and enhanced the interaction between CRYAB and STAT3, which further inhibited the activation and DNA-binding activity of STAT3.

Finally, the GSTM1 present genotype was confirmed to be significantly associated with both ATDH [Odds Ratio (OR): 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.90, P = 0.005] and SCZ (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.92, P = 0.004) according to the random-effect model.

While these drugs alleviate positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, they are less effective for treating cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Dopamine D3 receptors are highly expressed in areas of the brain thought to play a role in the regulation of motivation and reward-related behavior. Consequently, the dopamine D3 receptor has become a target for treating negative symptoms in combination with D2 antagonism to treat positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cariprazine receptor occupancies in brain for D2 and D3 receptors in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Using [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO as a radioligand, positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed in eight patients at baseline and postdose on days 1, 4, and 15. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed for cariprazine concentrations. RESULTS: A monotonic dose-occupancy relationship was observed for both receptor types. After 2 weeks of treatment, near complete ( approximately 100 %) occupancies were observed for both receptors at a dose of 12 mg/day. At the lowest cariprazine dose (1 mg/day), mean D3 and D2 receptor occupancies were 76 and 45 %, respectively, suggesting selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors at low doses. An exposure-response analysis found a approximately 3-fold difference in EC50 (D3 = 3.84 nM and D2 = 13.03 nM) in plasma after 2 weeks of dosing. CONCLUSION: This PET imaging study in patients with schizophrenia demonstrated that cariprazine is a D3-preferring dual D3/D2 receptor partial agonist.", "first_author": "Girgis, Ragy R", "date_published": "2016 October"}, {"pmid": "27403851", "title": "Effects of l-Tyrosine on working memory and inhibitory control are determined by DRD2 genotypes: A randomized controlled trial.", "abstract": "l-Tyrosine (TYR), the precursor of dopamine (DA), has been shown to enhance facets of cognitive control in situations with high cognitive demands. However some previous outcomes were mixed: some studies reported significant improvements, while other did not. Given that TYR increases DA level in the brain, we investigated, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, whether the C957T genotypes of a functional synonymous polymorphism in the human dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene (rs6277) contribute to individual differences in the reactivity to TYR administration and whether this factor predicts the magnitude of TYR-induced performance differences on inhibiting behavioral responses in a stop-signal task and working memory (WM) updating in a N-back task. Our findings show that T/T homozygotes (i.e., individuals potentially associated with lower striatal DA level) showed larger beneficial effects of TYR supplementation than C/C homozygotes (i.e., individuals potentially associated with higher striatal DA level), suggesting that genetically determined differences in DA function may explain inter-individual differences in response to TYR supplementation.

However, clinical responses to dopaminergic drugs vary substantially from person to person due to individual-, drug- and disease-related factors that may in part be genetically determined. Using clinical data and DNA samples ascertained through the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, rasagiline (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00256204), we examined how polymorphisms in candidate genes associate with the clinical response to rasagiline in early Parkinson's disease. Variants in genes that express proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rasagiline, and genes previously associated with the risk to develop Parkinson's disease were genotyped. The LifeTechnologies OpenArray NT genotyping platform and polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to analyse 204 single nucleotide polymorphisms and five variable number tandem repeats from 30 candidate genes in 692 available DNA samples from this clinical trial. The peak symptomatic response to rasagiline, the rate of symptom progression, and their relation to genetic variation were examined controlling for placebo effects using general linear and mixed effects models, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2283265 and rs1076560, in the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) were found to be significantly associated with a favourable peak response to rasagiline at 12 weeks in early Parkinson's disease after controlling for multiple testing. From a linear regression, the betas were 2.5 and 2.38, respectively, with false discovery rate-corrected P-values of 0.032. These polymorphisms were in high linkage disequilibrium with each other (r(2) = 0.96) meaning that the same clinical response signal was identified by each of them. No polymorphisms were associated with slowing the rate of worsening in Parkinson symptoms from Weeks 12 to 36 after correction for multiple testing. This is the largest and most comprehensive pharmacogenetics study to date examining clinical response to an anti-parkinsonian drug and the first to be conducted in patients with early stage Parkinson's disease receiving monotherapy. The results indicate a clinically meaningful benefit to rasagiline in terms of the magnitude of improvement in parkinsonian symptoms for those with the favourable response genotypes.

The overwhelming majority of cases are sporadic and without a clear familial history, and the genotype-phenotype correlation in PA patients is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of genes known for their role in familial cases on drug response and tumor suppression in the development and pathology of PAs in a patient group from Latvia. DESIGN: The study included 143 cases and 354 controls, we investigated the role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes (SSTR2, SSTR5, DRD2, MEN1, AIP, GNAS, and PRKAR1A) associated with pituitary tumor occurrence, phenotype, and clinical symptoms.

The databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched using the terms 'amphetamine psychosis' and 'methamphetamine psychosis' for the time period 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2015. RECENT FINDINGS: There were 37 studies published on the subject during this time period. Risk factors for psychotic symptoms, substance-induced psychosis, and primary psychosis included patterns of drug use, but results also pointed to the importance of nondrug-related vulnerability. Cognitive impairment is associated with both amphetamine use and psychosis, and the impairment among those with amphetamine-induced psychosis resembles that of schizophrenia. At the neuronal level, GABAergic mechanisms may offer some understanding about the association between stimulant use and psychosis. Several different types of antipsychotic medication are effective for treating agitation and psychosis, but drugs with high DRD2 blockade should be used with caution. Some novel treatments are described, but are not sufficiently repeated to be recommended. SUMMARY: During the past 18 months, studies have been published that cover risk factors, neuronal mechanisms, and treatment. These recent results do not differ from previous understandings, but the role of cognition and GABAergic dysfunction should be further investigated, and knowledge about resilience factors is still scarce. Also, a clearer evidence base for medical treatment of psychosis with concurrent amphetamine use is warranted.

The answer is of critical importance for understanding the neurobiological mechanism of addictive behavior.

METHODS: One hundred forty-seven children and adolescents with autism, aged 3 to 19 years, received risperidone. The clinical data of patients were recorded from medical records. Prolactin levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Three CYP2D6 single nucleotide polymorphisms, CYP2D6*4 (1846G>A), *10 (100C>T), and *41 (2988G>A), 1 gene deletion (*5), and DRD2 Taq1A (rs1800497) polymorphism were genotyped by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The 3 common allelic frequencies were CYP2D6*10 (55.10%), *1 (32.65%), and *5 (6.12%), respectively. Patients were grouped according to their CYP2D6 genotypes. There was no significant correlation between the concentrations of prolactin among the CYP2D6 genotypes. In addition, there were no statistical differences in the prolactin response among the CYP2D6-predicted phenotypes of extensive metabolizer and intermediate metabolizer. The DRD2 genotype frequencies were Taq1A A2A2 (38.77%), A1A2 (41.50%), and A1A1 (19.73%), respectively. There were statistically significant differences in prolactin level of patients among the 3 groups (P = 0.033). The median prolactin level in patients with DRD2 Taq1A A2A2 (17.80 ng/mL) was significantly higher than A1A2 (17.10 ng/mL) and A1A1 (12.70 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: DRD2 Taq1A A2A2 polymorphisms may play a significant role in the hyperprolactinemia- associated with risperidone treatment in children and adolescent with autism spectrum disorder. Many drugs used chronically in psychiatric diseases exert their effects mainly through the dopamine D2 receptor. It is therefore possible that these drugs could alter the expression of any dopamine receptor, thus affecting the pharmacodynamics characteristics and toxicity of drug substrates during pharmacotherapy.", "first_author": "Sukasem, Chonlaphat", "date_published": "2016 April"}, {"pmid": "26819282", "title": "Frontal D2/3 Receptor Availability in Schizophrenia Patients Before and After Their First Antipsychotic Treatment: Relation to Cognitive Functions and Psychopathology.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have previously reported associations between frontal D2/3 receptor binding potential positive symptoms and cognitive deficits in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia patients. Here, we examined the effect of dopamine D2/3 receptor blockade on cognition. Additionally, we explored the relation between frontal D2/3 receptor availability and treatment effect on positive symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-five antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients were examined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, tested with the cognitive test battery Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, scanned with single-photon emission computerized tomography using the dopamine D2/3 receptor ligand [(123)I]epidepride, and scanned with MRI. After 3 months of treatment with either risperidone (n=13) or zuclopenthixol (n=9), 22 patients were reexamined. RESULTS: Blockade of extrastriatal dopamine D2/3 receptors was correlated with decreased attentional focus (r = -0.615, P=.003) and planning time (r = -0.436, P=.048). Moreover, baseline frontal dopamine D2/3 binding potential and positive symptom reduction correlated positively (D2/3 receptor binding potential left frontal cortex rho = 0.56, P=.003; D2/3 receptor binding potential right frontal cortex rho = 0.48, P=.016). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis of a negative influence of D2/3 receptor blockade on specific cognitive functions in schizophrenia.

METHODS: The study included patients using risperidone (8-20 years old) and healthy subjects not exposed to the medication. Psychopathological symptoms, doses, and duration of treatment with risperidone, sex, skin color, body mass index (BMI), use of other psychotropic drugs, and polymorphisms of DRD2, HTR2C, CYP2D6, LEP, LEPR, MC4R, and SCARB2 genes were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 120 patients and 197 individuals not exposed to risperidone who were evaluated. Among patients, hyperprolactinemia was found in 79 (65.8%) cases, with no differences regarding sex, skin color, or being in monotherapy with risperidone (26.7% of total patients) or not. The level of prolactin was not correlated, either in case or control groups, with chronological age, bone age, prescribed dose of risperidone, weight-adjusted dose of risperidone, or BMI (p > 0.05), but was negatively correlated with the treatment duration (r = -0.352, p = 0.001 among cases; and r = -0.324, p = 0.039 among controls).

We tested recent hypotheses proposing that psychotic, or positive, symptoms stem from irregularities in long-range white matter tracts projecting into the frontal cortex, and we predicted that selective dopamine D2/3 receptor blockade would restore white matter. METHODS: Between December 2008 and July 2011, antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia and matched healthy controls underwent baseline examination with 3 T MRI diffusion tensor imaging and clinical assessments. We assessed group differences of fractional anisotropy (FA) using voxelwise tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and anatomic region of interest (ROI)-based analyses. Subsequently, patients underwent 6 weeks of antipsychotic monotherapy with amisulpride. We repeated the examinations after 6 weeks. RESULTS: We included 38 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 38 controls in our analysis, and 28 individuals in each group completed the study.

However, whether consumption of appetitive macronutrients themselves causes deficits in impulse control and striatal signalling, thereby contributing to cognitive changes permissive of overeating behaviour, has yet to be considered. We examined the effects of chronic maintenance on restricted equicaloric, but high-fat or high-sugar, diets (48 kcal/day; 60 kcal% fat or sucrose) on rats' performance in the five-choice serial reaction time task, indexing impulsivity and attention. Markers of dopamine signalling in the dorsal and ventral striatum, and plasma insulin and leptin levels, were also assessed. Rats maintained on the high-fat diet (HFD) were more impulsive, whereas the high-sugar diet (HSD) did not alter task performance. Importantly, body weight and hormone levels were similar between groups when behavioural changes were observed. Maintenance on HFD, but not on HSD, reduced the levels of dopamine D2 receptor (D2 R), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphophorylated CREB (Ser133) proteins in the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum.

Nicotine administered at the active period appears to be responsible for the effect on blood glucose, because nighttime but not daytime injections of nicotine lowered blood glucose levels in db/db mice. The chronic oral treatment with nicotine suppressed the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphatase, the rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis, in the liver of db/db and wild-type control mice. In the pyruvate tolerance test to evaluate hepatic gluconeogenic activity, the oral nicotine treatment moderately suppressed glucose elevations in normal mice and mice lacking dopamine receptors, whereas this effect was abolished in orexin-deficient mice and hepatic parasympathectomized mice. Under high-fat diet conditions, the oral intake of nicotine lowered blood glucose levels at the daytime resting period in wild-type, but not orexin-deficient, mice.

Until now, little has been known about the development of craving symptoms in novice smokers. The aim of this study was to identify specific genetic (i.e., DRD2 Taq1A, DRD4 48 bp VNTR, and OPRM1 A118G polymorphisms) and environmental mechanisms that underlie the emergence of both cue-induced and cognitive craving among adolescent novice smokers. METHOD: A five-wave longitudinal, genetically-informed survey study was conducted with intervals of four months. The sample included 376 early adolescent smokers (12-13 years of age at baseline). Self-report questionnaires were completed regarding smoking behavior, observed parental smoking behavior, and both cue-induced and cognitive craving. RESULTS: Data were analyzed with a latent growth curve approach. For both cue-induced and cognitive craving, significant interaction effects were found for DRD2 Taq1A with parental smoke exposure. A1-allele carriers did not seem to be influenced by the environment with regard to craving development. Adolescents who are homozygous for the A2-allele and who are more exposed to parental smoking experience the highest levels of both types of craving over time. No significant interaction effects were found between parental smoke exposure and DRD4 48 bp VNTR or OPRM1 A118G. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies identified DRD2 Taq1A A1-allele carriers as vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence. However, this study showed that parental smoking increased the chances of developing dependence more rapidly for early adolescents who are considered to be less sensitive to the rewarding effects of nicotine according to their DRD2 Taq1A genotype. It is thus especially important that these young people not be exposed to smoking in their social environment.", "first_author": "Kleinjan, Marloes", "date_published": "2015 October 8"}, {"pmid": "26442600", "title": "Varenicline-Induced Elevation of Dopamine in Smokers: A Preliminary [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO PET Study.", "abstract": "Varenicline, a nicotinic partial agonist, is the most effective treatment for tobacco use disorder.

The association between response to methadone treatment and genes that are involved in substance use behaviors and reward mechanisms is poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting their contribution to opioid use disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) polymorphisms on continued opioid use among patients on methadone treatment for opioid use disorder. METHODS: BDNF 196G>A (rs6265) and DRD2-241A>G (rs1799978) genetic variants were examined in patients with opioid use disorder who were recruited from methadone treatment clinics across Southern Ontario, Canada. We collected demographic information, substance use history, blood for genetic analysis, and urine to measure opioid use. We used regression analysis to examine the association between continued opioid use and genetic variants, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, methadone dose, duration in treatment, and number of urine screens. RESULTS: Among 240 patients treated with methadone for opioid use disorder, 36.3 percent (n = 87) and 11.3 percent (n = 27) had at least one risk allele for rs6265 and rs1799978, respectively. These genetic variants were not significantly associated with continued opioid use while on methadone maintenance treatment [rs6265: odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.792, 2.371, p = 0.264; rs1799978: OR 1.27, 95 % CI 0.511, 3.182, p = 0.603]. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an association of BDNF rs6265 and DRD2 rs1799978 with addictive behaviors, these variants were not associated with continued illicit opioid use in patients treated with methadone. Problematic use of opioids throughout treatment with methadone may be attributed to nongenetic factors or a polygenic effect requiring further exploration.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism with PONV in a high-risk cohort of patients. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind observational trial. SETTING: Single-centre primary care in Western Germany. PATIENTS: A total of 306 patients undergoing elective strabismus surgery under anaesthesia with etomidate/alfentanil/mivacurium (induction) and sevoflurane in air (maintenance). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nausea as well as retching/vomiting was recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism (rs1800497) was genotyped using a Taqman assay and the relationship between DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and PONV was examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Regarding known risk factors for developing PONV, no patient with the A1A1 genotype (n = 15) had a history of PONV, while A1A2 carriers (n = 115) and A2A2 carriers (n = 176) had a history of PONV in 22.6 and 10.8% of patients, respectively (P = 0.005). Overall, the incidence of nausea was 40.1% and the incidence of vomiting/retching was 32.7%. Univariate analysis showed that postoperative nausea was not associated with TaqIA genotypes, but the incidence of retching/vomiting in A1A2 and A2A2 genotypes was more than 34% compared with zero in A1A1 genotypes (P = 0.022). Age, sex, smoking status and a history of PONV were independent predictors for nausea as well as for retching/vomiting, as expected, while DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism showed no independent significant impact.

RESULTS: We found that genotype frequency of the rs1800544 polymorphism in the DRD4 gene was significantly different between responders and non-responders (P<0.05). Also the frequency of the rs1800544 CG genotype was significantly higher (P<0.05) in responders (51.4%) than that in non-responders (35.8%). No significant difference was found between responders and non-responders, remission and non-remission groups in the SNPs polymorphisms in the TPH, SLC6A2, SLC6A3, or DRD2 genes. The combination of all neuroendocrine factors, clinical characteristics and gene polymorphisms predicted 74.8% of the variation in SSRI response and 65.5% in SSRI remission.

Similarly, functional variation in the genes encoding these receptors is also associated with these phenotypes. In particular, the DRD2 rs1076560 T allele predicts a lower ratio of expression of D2 short/long isoforms, suboptimal working memory processing, and better response to antipsychotic treatment compared with the G allele. Furthermore, the HTR2A T allele is associated with lower 5-HT2A expression, impaired working memory processing, and poorer response to antipsychotics compared with the C allele. Here, we investigated in healthy subjects whether these functional polymorphisms have a combined effect on prefrontal cortical physiology and related cognitive behavior linked to schizophrenia as well as on response to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia. In a total sample of 620 healthy subjects, we found that subjects with the rs1076560 T and rs6314 T alleles have greater fMRI prefrontal activity during working memory. Similar results were obtained within the attentional domain. Also, the concomitant presence of the rs1076560 T/rs6314 T alleles also predicted lower behavioral accuracy during working memory. Moreover, we found that rs1076560 T carrier/rs6314 CC individuals had better responses to antipsychotic treatment in two independent samples of patients with schizophrenia (n=63 and n=54, respectively), consistent with the previously reported separate effects of these genotypes. These results indicate that DRD2 and HTR2A genetic variants together modulate physiological prefrontal efficiency during working memory and also modulate the response to antipsychotics.

RESULTS: Methadone maintenance dose was correlated to the highest dose ever used (r(2) = 0.57, P < 0.0001). Fractioned methadone intake (odds ratio 4.87, 95% confidence interval 1.27-18.6, P = 0.02), bodyweight (odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.44, P = 0.04), history of cocaine dependence (80 vs. 44 mg day(-1) in never-addict patients, P = 0.005) and ethnicity (Asian > Caucasian > African, P = 0.04) were independently associated with high-dose methadone in multiple regression analysis. A modest correlation was observed between liver/intestinal CYP3A4 activity and methadone dose at steady state (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [rs ] = 0.21, P = 0.06) but not with highest dose ever used (rs = 0.15, P = 0.18) or dose-normalized R,S-methadone trough concentrations (rs = -0.05, P = 0.64).

METHODS: The mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan((R))), and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Tumours were classified according to the percentage of immunostained cells for DR2 as scores 1 (<50% of stained cells) or 2 (>/=50%). Cabergoline was started at least 6 months after surgery in nine patients with residual tumours (3 mg/week). The cabergoline effect was prospectively evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging using three-dimensional volume calculation. TV reduction >25% was considered significant. RESULTS: The DR2 mRNA expression was variable but was observed in 100% of the samples (N = 20). DR2 protein expression was also observed in all the tumours (N = 34). Twenty-nine tumours (85%) were classified as score 2. The median DR2 mRNA expression was higher in the tumours classified as score 2 compared with score 1 (P = 0.007).

To determine whether such impairment occurs in the NAc in a cell-type-specific manner, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of gene regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1) or dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2) to identify distinct subpopulations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that bath application of group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) reliably induced LTD in both NAc shell and core MSNs of wild-type, hemizygous Drd1-eGFP, and Drd2-eGFP mice. Confirming our previous results, cocaine withdrawal selectively impaired DHPG-LTD in NAc shell Drd1-expressing direct and Drd2-expressing indirect pathway MSNs. We also found that the expression of DHPG-LTD in NAc MSNs was not affected by the Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine. Furthermore, systemic administration of mGluR5-negative allosteric modulator fenobam before the daily injection of cocaine preserved mGluR5 function and significantly reduced the expression of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. These results reveal that withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure may result in the impairment of NAc mGluR5-LTD in a subregion- but not cell-type-specific manner and suggests that pharmacological antagonism of mGluR5 may represent a potential strategy for reducing cocaine-induced addictive behaviors.", "first_author": "Huang, Chiung-Chun", "date_published": "2015 December"}, {"pmid": "25306742", "title": "[Use of itopride in the symptoms of functional dyspepsia in Russia: results of a phase IV prospective open-label multicenter clinical trial].", "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of itopride used to treat the symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

An important health concern of welding fume (WF) exposure is neurological dysfunction akin to Parkinson's disease (PD). Some applications in manufacturing industry employ a variant welding technology known as \"weld-bonding\" that utilizes resistance spot welding, in combination with adhesives, for metal-to-metal welding. The presence of adhesives raises additional concerns about worker exposure to potentially toxic components like Methyl Methacrylate, Bisphenol A and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we investigated the potential neurotoxicological effects of exposure to welding aerosols generated during weld-bonding. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed (25 mg/m(3) targeted concentration; 4 h/day x 13 days) by whole-body inhalation to filtered air or aerosols generated by either weld-bonding with sparking (high metal, low VOCs; HM) or without sparking (low metal; high VOCs; LM). Fumes generated under these conditions exhibited complex aerosols that contained both metal oxide particulates and VOCs. LM aerosols contained a greater fraction of VOCs than HM, which comprised largely metal particulates of ultrafine morphology. Short-term exposure to LM aerosols caused distinct changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT), in various brain areas examined. LM aerosols also specifically decreased the mRNA expression of the olfactory marker protein (Omp) and tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) in the olfactory bulb. Consistent with the decrease in Th, LM also reduced the expression of dopamine transporter (Slc6a3; Dat), as well as, dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2) in the olfactory bulb. In contrast, HM aerosols induced the expression of Th and dopamine D5 receptor (Drd5) mRNAs, elicited neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier-related changes in the olfactory bulb, but did not alter the expression of Omp. Our findings divulge the differential effects of LM and HM aerosols in the brain and suggest that exposure to weld-bonding aerosols can potentially elicit neurotoxicity following a short-term exposure. However, further investigations are warranted to determine if the aerosols generated by weld-bonding can contribute to persistent long-term neurological deficits and/or neurodegeneration.", "first_author": "Sriram, Krishnan", "date_published": "2014 October"}, {"pmid": "25185985", "title": "Pharmacogenomics in psychiatry: implications for practice.", "abstract": "Psychotropic medications are used for numerous psychiatric and neurologic disorders, and are associated with in some cases life-threatening adverse effects, high acquisition costs, stringent monitoring requirements, and potential interactions with other medications.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine pharmacogenetic relationships between GRM3 and selected variants in relevant dopamine genes with changes in spatial working memory and clinical symptoms after treatment. METHODS: Sixty-one untreated first-episode schizophrenia patients were assessed before and after 6 weeks of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy, primarily consisting of risperidone. Patients' level of cognitive performance on a spatial working memory task was assessed with a translational oculomotor paradigm. Changes after treatment in cognitive and clinical measures were examined in relationship to genetic polymorphisms in the GRM3, COMT, and DRD2/ANKK1 gene regions. RESULTS: Spatial working memory performance worsened after antipsychotic treatment. This worsening was associated with GRM3 rs1468412, with the genetic subgroup of patients known to have altered glutamate activity having greater adverse changes in working memory performance after antipsychotic treatment. Negative symptom improvement was associated with GRM3 rs6465084. There were no pharmacogenetic associations between DRD2/ANKK1 and COMT with working memory changes or symptom response to treatment.

We identified a specific disruption of synaptic transmission at thalamocortical glutamatergic projections in the auditory cortex in murine models of schizophrenia-associated 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS).

Dopaminergic neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD) and are prone to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In order to provide insights into the neuroprotective potential of TRO19622 and TRO40303 for dopaminergic neurons in vivo, we assessed their effects on gene expression in laser captured nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of wildtype mice and of mice that over-express alpha-synuclein, a protein involved in both familial and sporadic forms of PD (Thy1-aSyn mice). Young mice were fed the drugs in food pellets or a control diet from 1 to 4months of age, approximately 10months before the appearance of striatal dopamine loss in this model. Unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptional changes revealed effects of cholesterol oximes on transcripts related to mitochondria, cytoprotection and anti-oxidant response in wild-type and transgenic mice, including increased transcription of stress defense (e.g. Prdx1, Prdx2, Glrx2, Hspa9, Pink1, Drp1, Trak1) and dopamine-related (Th, Ddc, Gch1, Dat, Vmat2, Drd2, Chnr6a) genes. Even at this young age transgenic mice showed alterations in transcripts implicated in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress (e.g. Bcl-2, Bax, Casp3, Nos2), and both drugs normalized about 20% of these alterations. Young Thy1-aSyn mice exhibit motor deficits that differ from parkinsonism and are established before the onset of treatment; these deficits were not improved by cholesterol oximes. However, high doses of TRO40303 improved olfaction and produced the same effects as dopamine agonists on a challenging beam test, specifically an increase in footslips, an observation congruent with its effects on transcripts involved in dopamine synthesis. High doses of TRO19622 increased alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra; this effect, not seen with TRO40303 was inconsistent and may represent a protective mechanism as in other neurodegenerative diseases.

We examined the expression and downstream activity of dopamine receptors (DR) in the striatum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropiridine (MPTP)-lesioned monkeys with and without L-DOPA treatment. Four monkeys were made dyskinetic and other four received a shorter course of L-DOPA and did not develop LID. Our results show that L-DOPA treatment induces an increase in DRD2 and DRD3 expression in the postcommissural putamen, but only DRD3 is correlated with the severity of LID. Dyskinetic monkeys show a hyperactivation of the canonical DRD1-signaling pathway, measured by an increased phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and its substrates, particularly DARPP32. In contrast, activation of the DRD2-signaling pathway, visible in the levels of Akt phosphorylated on Thr308 and GSK3beta on Ser9, is associated with L-DOPA treatment, independently of the presence of dyskinesias. Our data clearly demonstrate that dyskinetic monkeys present a dysregulation of the DRD3 receptor and the DRD1 pathway with a sustained increase of PKA activity in the postcommissural putamen.

The magnitude of eye movement abnormality in patients was defined in relation to performance of matched healthy controls (N = 130). Eighty three patients were followed after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. At baseline, patients with a -141C deletion in DRD2 rs1799732 had slower initiation eye velocity and longer pursuit latency than CC insertion carriers. Further, GRM3 rs274622_CC carriers had poorer pursuit maintenance than T-carriers. Antipsychotic treatment resulted in prolonged pursuit latency in DRD2 rs1799732_CC insertion carriers and a decline in pursuit maintenance in GRM3 rs6465084_GG carriers. The present study demonstrates for the first time that neurophysiological measures of motor and neurocognitive deficits in patients with psychotic disorders have different associations with genes regulating dopamine and glutamate systems, respectively. Alterations in striatal D2 receptor activity through the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism could contribute to pursuit initiation deficits in psychotic disorders.

Both miRs targeted the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of DRD2 in NT2 (neuron-committed teratocarcinoma, which endogenously expresses DRD2) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines, decreasing luciferase activity measured by a luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-326 overexpression reduced DRD2 mRNA and DRD2 receptor synthesis. Both antisense miR-326 and antisense miR-9 increased DRD2 protein abundance, suggesting an endogenous repression of DRD2 expression by both miRs. Furthermore, a genetic variant (rs1130354) within the DRD2 3'-UTR miR-targeting site interferes with miR-326-mediated repression of DRD2 expression.

Because paliperidone differs from risperidone by only a single hydroxyl group, questions have been raised as to whether there are significant differences in the effects elicited between these two drugs. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We compared the relative efficacies of paliperidone versus risperidone to regulate several cellular signalling pathways coupled to four selected GPCR targets that are important for either therapeutic or adverse effects: human dopamine D2 , human serotonin 2A receptor subtype (5-HT2A ), human serotonin 2C receptor subtype and human histamine H1 receptors. KEY RESULTS: Whereas the relative efficacies of paliperidone and risperidone were the same for some responses, significant differences were found for several receptor-signalling systems, with paliperidone having greater or less relative efficacy than risperidone depending upon the receptor-response pair. Interestingly, for 5-HT2A -mediated recruitment of beta-arrestin, 5-HT2A -mediated sensitization of ERK, and dopamine D2 -mediated sensitization of adenylyl cyclase signalling, both paliperidone and risperidone behaved as agonists. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that the single hydroxyl group of paliperidone promotes receptor conformations that can differ from those of risperidone leading to differences in the spectrum of regulation of cellular signal transduction cascades. Such differences in signalling at the cellular level could lead to differences between paliperidone and risperidone in therapeutic efficacy or in the generation of adverse effects.", "first_author": "Clarke, W P", "date_published": "2013 October"}, {"pmid": "23802603", "title": "Use of magnetic resonance imaging in pharmacogenomics.", "abstract": "Because of the large variation in the response to psychoactive medication, many studies have attempted to uncover genetic factors that determine response.

This article reviews the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize response to medication in brain behaviour circuits in vivo in humans and assess the influence of pharmacogenetic factors. Two types of studies have been used to characterize effects of medication and genetic variation. In task-related activation studies the focus is on changes in the activity of a neural circuit associated with a specific psychological process. The second type of study investigates resting state perfusion. These studies provide an assessment of vascular changes associated with bioavailability of drugs in the brain, but may also assess changes in neural activity after binding of centrally active agents. Task-related pharmacogenetic studies of cognitive function have characterized the effects in the prefrontal cortex of genetic polymorphisms of dopamine receptors (DRD2), metabolic enzymes (COMT) and in the post-synaptic signalling cascade under the administration of dopamine agonists and antagonists.

The gene/drug pairings with the strongest potential for pharmacogenetic recommendations include: CYP2C19/benztropine, COMT/levodopa and entacapone, CYP2B6/selegiline, UGT1A/entacapone, DRD2/ropinirole, pramipexole and cabergoline, and DRD3/ropinirole and pramipexole.

Treatment of aggression is equally heterogeneous with structural (environmental), behavioral, and pharmacologic approaches. Among medications, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are usually considered first line. Antidepressants are frequently recommended but their anti-aggression effect is limited. Within the available limited data, clozapine stands out as more effective than other antipsychotic medications. One of the prominent differences between clozapine and less effective medications is that the affinity of the compound to the dopamine D4 receptor is quite high and significantly greater than to the D2 receptor (defined as a ratio that is >1). Medications that inhibit both receptors equally, e.g., haloperidol, have anti-aggression properties that are less than seen with clozapine. A specific variant of the D4 receptor with an expansion of the third cytoplasmic loop, which interacts with the G protein second messenger system, has been implicated in the etiology of aggression. The proposal is put forward that blockade of the D4 receptor, without concomitant significant blockade of D2, increases the anti-aggression effect of the medication.

First, we investigated the role of dopamine in inhibitory control and associated brain activation. Second, the proposed link between dopamine and impaired inhibitory control in nicotine dependence was investigated by comparing smokers and non-smoking controls. Haloperidol (2 mg), a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist, and placebo were administered to 25 smokers and 25 non-smoking controls in a double-blind randomized cross-over design while performing a Go/NoGo task during fMRI scanning. Haloperidol reduced NoGo accuracy and associated brain activation in the ACC, right SFG and left IFG, showing that optimal dopamine levels are crucial to effectively implement inhibitory control. In addition, smokers showed behavioral deficits on the Go/NoGo task as well as hypoactivity in the left IFG, right MFG and ACC after placebo, supporting the hypothesis of a hypoactive prefrontal system in smokers. Haloperidol had a stronger impact on prefrontal brain activation in non-smoking controls compared to smokers, which is in line with the inverted 'U' curve theory of dopamine and cognitive control.

However, it is not yet known whether these processes can be modulated pharmacologically in smokers, other than with nicotine or tobacco. METHODS: A double-blind placebo controlled crossover design assessed the effects of 0.5 mg pramipexole, a dopamine D(2)/D(3) agonist, in smokers following 2 h of abstinence. Reward responsivity was measured using an effort-based card sorting task. Temporal discounting of monetary reward was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis, and affective and subjective effects were indexed. RESULTS: On placebo, smokers showed an equivalent speed of card sorting when a financial incentive was provided compared to when it was not. Conversely, more cards were sorted under rewarded compared to non-rewarded trials after pramipexole, indicating an improvement in reward responsivity. Temporal discounting of monetary reward was not affected by pramipexole. Drug treatment also decreased positive affect and increased drowsiness.

However, less is known about genetic control over component working memory cortical-subcortical networks in humans, and the pharmacogenetic implications of dopamine-related genes on cognition in patients receiving anti-dopaminergic drugs. Here, we examined predictions from basic models of dopaminergic signalling in cortical and cortical-subcortical circuitries implicated in dissociable working memory maintenance and manipulation processes. We also examined pharmacogenetic effects on cognition in the context of anti-dopaminergic drug therapy. Using dynamic causal models of functional magnetic resonance imaging in normal subjects (n = 46), we identified differentiated effects of functional polymorphisms in COMT, DRD2 and AKT1 genes on prefrontal-parietal and prefrontal-striatal circuits engaged during maintenance and manipulation, respectively. Cortical synaptic dopamine monitored by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism influenced prefrontal control of both parietal processing in working memory maintenance and striatal processing in working memory manipulation. DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms implicated in DRD2 signalling influenced only the prefrontal-striatal network associated with manipulation. In the context of anti-psychotic drugs, the DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms altered dose-response effects of anti-psychotic drugs on cognition in schizophrenia (n = 111).

METHODS: The dataset from the CATIE trial was used in the present analysis. Data were extracted from 410 subjects who were treated with risperidone, olanzapine, or ziprasidone, received assessments for neurocognitive functions (verbal memory, vigilance, processing speed, reasoning, and working memory) and psychopathology, and provided plasma samples for the measurement of plasma antipsychotic concentrations. D2 receptor occupancy levels on the day of neurocognitive assessment were estimated from plasma antipsychotic concentrations, using population pharmacokinetic analysis and our recently developed model. A multivariate general linear model was used to examine effects of clinical and demographic characteristics, including estimated D2 occupancy levels, on neurocognitive functions. RESULTS: D2 occupancy levels showed significant associations with the vigilance and the summary scores. Neurocognitive functions, including vigilance, were especially impaired in subjects who showed D2 receptor occupancy level of >77%. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest a nonlinear relationship between prescribed antipsychotic doses and overall neurocognitive function and vigilance.

The A1(+) genotype (A1/A1, A1/A2) has been associated with smoking dependence. The present study determined which polymorphism of the DRD2 gene had a salutary outcome in administration of rimonabant, a drug used in smoking cessation and obesity studies. METHODS: Seventy-six (76) smokers enrolled into a double-blind, placebo-versus-rimonabant, 10-week smoking cessation drug trial. Subjects provided a blood sample to determine whether they had the DRD2 A1(+) genotype (A1/A1, A1/A2) or the DRD2 A1(-) genotype (A2/A2). Smoking cessation (or continuation) was monitored on a weekly basis with on-site carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring. RESULTS: Smokers in the rimonabant A1(-) group were significantly more successful in completely stopping smoking compared to subjects in the placebo A1(-) group (P < 0.05). However, there was no difference in smoking cessation when the rimonabant A1(+) group was compared to the placebo A1(+) group. With respect to quantified verifiable/objective smoking cessation outcomes, exhaled CO (parts per million) was monitored during each week of the study. The rimonabant A1(-) group compared to the placebo A1(-) group was quantifiably smoking less at weeks 5, 6, and 7 (P < 0.05), at week 8 (P < 0.01), and at weeks 9 and 10 (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in exhaled CO levels between rimonabant A1(+) group and the placebo A1(+) group in any of the weeks studied. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support the rationale for incorporating genotyping into clinical trials, particularly smoking cessation trials. Rimonabant demonstrated early and sustained smoking cessation efficacy only in noncarriers of the A1 allele.

These findings suggest that DRD2 polymorphisms are associated with the therapeutic effects of risperidone as they relate to positive symptoms and that plasma drug concentrations are associated with overall symptoms as well as excitement and cognitive symptoms.

METHODS: Striatal dopamine and opioid-related genes were studied in human fetal subjects exposed to cannabis (as well as cigarettes and alcohol). Cannabis-related gene disturbances observed in the human fetus were subsequently characterized with an animal model of prenatal Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (.15 mg/kg) exposure. RESULTS: Prenatal cannabis exposure decreased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) messenger RNA expression in the human ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens [NAc]), a key brain reward region. No significant alterations were observed for the other genes in cannabis-exposed subjects. Maternal cigarette use was associated with reduced NAc prodynorphin messenger RNA expression, and alcohol exposure induced broad alterations primarily in the dorsal striatum of most genes. To explore the mechanisms underlying the cannabis-associated disturbances, we exposed pregnant rats to THC and examined the epigenetic regulation of the NAc Drd2 gene in their offspring at postnatal day 2, comparable to the human fetal period studied, and in adulthood. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the adult NAc revealed increased 2meH3K9 repressive mark and decreased 3meH3K4 and RNA polymerase II at the Drd2 gene locus in the THC-exposed offspring. Decreased Drd2 expression was accompanied by reduced dopamine D2 receptor (D(2)R) binding sites and increased sensitivity to opiate reward in adulthood.

Only a few examined the more acute antipsychotic-induced MD such as parkinsonism and akathisia. Notably, all MD relate to deregulation of the dopamine system. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to replicate previously reported associations in candidate genes for acute and tardive antipsychotic-induced MD in a young Caucasian sample. METHODS: In 402 patients (median age 26 years), a total of 13 polymorphisms were genotyped in eight dopamine-related candidate genes selected a priori from the literature (regarding dopamine and serotonin receptors, dopamine degradation, and free radicals scavenging enzymes pathways). RESULTS: Patients with MD used on average a higher haloperidol dose equivalent when compared to those without MD. The prevalence of MD was high and did not differ between first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Significant associations were found between (a) the TaqI_D polymorphism and akathisia (OR = 2.3, p = 0.001 for each extra C-allele) and (b) the -141C polymorphism and tardive dyskinesia (OR = 0.20, p = 0.001 for each extra Del allele). The other polymorphisms were not significantly associated with an MD. CONCLUSIONS: Two associations were found between genetic variation TaqI_D and the -141C polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene and antipsychotic-induced MD; one with acute akathisia and one with tardive dyskinesia. These were previously reported to be associated with tardive dyskinesia and acute parkinsonism, respectively.

This study aimed to determine the influence of genetic polymorphisms in the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genes, and the possible role of blood prolactin concentrations on sexual function in schizophrenic patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: Male remitted schizophrenic patients (n = 100), who were living with a sexual partner and receiving antipsychotic drug monotherapy for at least 6 months, were assessed for sexual and erectile dysfunction using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function. Blood samples were taken for plasma prolactin determination and genotyped for four polymorphisms: DRD2 (-141C Ins/Del and Taq1A) and eNOS gene (G894T and T-786C). RESULTS: The -141C Ins/Del, but not Taq1A, polymorphism of the DRD2 gene was significantly associated with sexual dysfunction with the del allele being less frequent in sexual dysfunction subjects. Neither of the eNOS polymorphisms, G894T or T-786C, was significantly associated with sexual or erectile dysfunction. Prolactin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with erectile dysfunction but did not reach significance in those with sexual dysfunction. Prolactin was also reduced in -141C Del allele carriers. The frequency and severity of sexual dysfunction in the patients receiving typical antipsychotics was significantly greater than those receiving risperidone or clozapine, while prolactin concentrations were significantly higher in subjects receiving risperidone compared with those receiving clozapine or typical antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence indicating that antipsychotic drug treatment in men is associated with a variant in the DRD2 gene in which the -141C Del allele might be a protective factor.

We aimed to determine how a range of polymorphisms in noradrenergic and dopaminergic genes influence this response to treatment and how they interact with childhood trauma and recent life stress in a Chinese sample. METHODS: In a sample of 308 Chinese Han patients with major depressive disorder, 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions of six genes (MAOA, SLC6A2, TH, COMT, DRD2, DRD3) with minor allele frequencies >5% were successfully genotyped from an initial series of 35 SNPs in 11 candidate genes associated with catecholamine neurotransmission. The responses to 6 weeks' treatment with antidepressant drugs was determined by changes in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score, and previous stressful events were evaluated by the Life Events Scale (LES) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF).

Researchers have posited that an individual's inherited behavioral propensity or temperament contributes to the disorder by shaping a personality strongly linked with the risk of drug abuse. Further, they hypothesize that the polymorphism of dopamine D2 receptor increases the susceptibility to and severity of addiction. We, therefore, investigated possible associations between dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and personality traits among intravenous heroin addicts. METHODS: We assessed 93 intravenous heroin addicts and controls using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). We confirmed drug-dependence status using a questionnaire based on DSM-IV criteria. We extracted DNA from the subjects' whole blood and genotyped it for DRD2 allelic variants. RESULTS: Genotype analysis showed a significantly higher frequency for the TaqIA polymorphism among the addicts (69.9%) compared to control subjects (42.6%; Fisher's exact chi(2), p < .05). We observed no significant differences for other variants between the addicts and controls. The addicts had higher scores for novelty seeking (NS) and harm avoidance (HA) personality traits but lower scores for reward dependence (RD) when compared to control subjects.

The existence of unique large size families linked to multiple regions, and the fact that these families came from an isolated population, we hypothesized that two-locus interaction contributions to ADHD were plausible. Several analytical models converged to show significant interaction between 4q and 11q (P<1 x 10(-8)) and 11q and 17p (P<1 x 10(-6)). As we have identified that common variants of the LPHN3 gene were responsible for the 4q linkage signal, we focused on 4q-11q interaction to determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) harbored in the LPHN3 gene interact with SNPs spanning the 11q region that contains DRD2 and NCAM1 genes, to double the risk of developing ADHD. This interaction not only explains genetic effects much better than taking each of these loci effects by separated but also differences in brain metabolism as depicted by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy data and pharmacogenetic response to stimulant medication.

C57Bl6 mice were classified as DIO or DR based on their weight gain during 10 weeks of high fat feeding. Subsequently DIO mice were treated with the DRD2 agonist bromocriptine and DR mice with the DRD2 antagonist haloperidol for 2 weeks. Compared to DR mice, the bodyweight of DIO mice was higher and their insulin sensitivity decreased. Haloperidol treatment reduced the voluntary activity and energy expenditure of DR mice and induced insulin resistance in these mice. Conversely, bromocriptine treatment tended to reduce bodyweight and voluntary activity, and reinforce insulin action in DIO mice. These results show that DRD2 activation partly redirects high fat diet induced metabolic anomalies in obesity-prone mice. Conversely, blocking DRD2 induces an adverse metabolic profile in mice that are inherently resistant to the deleterious effects of high fat food.

In healthy subjects, we found that the interaction between the T allele of DRD2 rs1076560 and the A allele of AKT1 rs1130233 was associated with reduced AKT1 protein levels and reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, as well as with altered cingulate response and reduced behavioral accuracy during attentional processing.

The pathogenesis of dyskinesia may result from divergent changes in dopamine D1 receptors (DRD1) and dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) in the brain while aging. Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a kind of dyskinesia, may develop after long-term antipsychotic treatment. Because the prevalence of TD also steadily increased with age, TD has been suggested to be the consequence of an imbalance between DRD1 and DRD2. We supposed that patients who develop TD may have genetic variants of DRD1 that cause the excitatory effects of DRD1 overwhelming the attenuated inhibitory effects of DRD2 after antipsychotic treatment. METHODS: In the present study, schizophrenic inpatients receiving long-term antipsychotic treatment were first assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and only patients who were either free of any abnormal involuntary movements (non-TD group, AIMS =0) or who showed persistent TD (TD group) were enrolled. Finally, 382 patients were recruited (TD=220, non-TD=162) and three single nucleus polymorphisms (SNPs; rs5326, rs4532 and rs265975) of DRD1 were genotyped for each subject. RESULTS: Genotype frequency (%; AA/AG/GG) of rs4532 (TD: non-TD) was 61.4/35.8/2.8: 74.2/24.5/1.3.

Evidence is emerging whereby the potential of utilizing a natural, nonaddicting, safe, putative D2 agonist may find its place in recovery from reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) in patients addicted to psychoactive chemicals. Utilizing quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as an imaging tool, we show the impact of Synaptamine Complex Variant KB220 as a putative activator of the mesolimbic system. We demonstrate for the first time that its intravenous administration reduces or \"normalizes\" aberrant electrophysiological parameters of the reward circuitry site. For this pilot study, we report that the qEEGs of an alcoholic and a heroin abuser with existing abnormalities (ie, widespread theta and widespread alpha activity, respectively) during protracted abstinence are significantly normalized by the administration of 1 intravenous dose of Synaptamine Complex Variant KB220. Both patients were genotyped for a number of neurotransmitter reward genes to determine to what extent they carry putative dopaminergic risk alleles that may predispose them for alcohol or heroin dependence, respectively. The genes tested included the dopamine transporter (DAT1, locus symbol SLC6A3), dopamine D4 receptor exon 3 VNTR (DRD4), DRD2 TaqIA (rs1800497), COMT val158 met SNP (rs4680), monoamine oxidase A upstream VNTR (MAOA-uVNTR), and serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR, locus symbol SLC6A4). We emphasize that these are case studies, and it would be unlikely for all individuals to carry all putative risk alleles. Based on previous research and our qEEG studies (parts 1 and 2 of this study), we cautiously suggest that long-term activation of dopaminergic receptors (ie, DRD2 receptors) will result in their proliferation and lead to enhanced \"dopamine sensitivity\" and an increased sense of happiness, particularly in carriers of the DRD2 A1 allele. This is supported by a clinical trial on Synaptamine Complex Variant KB220 using intravenous administration in > 600 alcoholic patients, resulting in significant reductions in RDS behaviors. It is also confirmed by the expanded oral study on Synaptose Complex KB220Z, published as part 2 of this study. Future studies must await both functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scanning to determine the acute and chronic effects of oral KB220 on numbers of D2 receptors and direct interaction at the nucleus accumbens.

Effectiveness and side-effects from domperidone may be influenced by patient-related factors including polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and domperidone targets. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine if demographic and pharmacogenetic parameters of patients receiving domperidone are associated with response to treatment or side-effects. METHODS: Patients treated with domperidone for gastroparesis provided saliva samples from which DNA was extracted. Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven candidate genes (ABCB1, CYP2D6, DRD2, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNH2, KCNQ1) were used for genotyping. SNP microarrays were used to assess single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADRA1A, ADRA1B, and ADRA1D loci. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients treated with domperidone participated in the study. DNA was successfully obtained from each patient. Age was associated with effectiveness of domperidone (p=0.0088). Genetic polymorphism in KCNH2 was associated with effectiveness of domperidone (p=0.041). The efficacious dose was associated with polymorphism in ABCB1 gene (p=0.0277). The side-effects of domperidone were significantly associated with the SNPs in the promoter region of ADRA1D gene. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic characteristics associated with response to domperidone therapy included polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1, the potassium channel KCNH2 gene, and alpha1D--adrenoceptor ADRA1D gene.

It improves insulin sensitivity and delays the age-related loss of dopamine receptor D(2) (DRD2) expression in the brain. Conversely, high-fat feeding is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and a reduced number of DRD2 binding sites. We hypothesised that the metabolic benefit of calorie restriction involves the preservation of appropriate DRD2 transmission. The food intake of wild-type C57Bl6 male mice was restricted to 60% of ad lib. intake while they were treated with the DRD2 antagonist haloperidol or vehicle using s.c. implanted pellets. Mice with ad lib. access to food receiving vehicle treatment served as controls. All mice received high-fat food throughout the experiment. After 10 weeks, an i.p. glucose tolerance test was performed and, after 12 weeks, a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. Hypothalamic DRD2 binding was also determined after 12 weeks of treatment. Calorie-restricted (CR) vehicle mice were glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive compared to ad lib. (AL) fed vehicle mice. CR mice treated with haloperidol were slightly heavier than vehicle treated CR mice. Haloperidol completely abolished the beneficial impact of calorie restriction on glucose tolerance and partly reduced the insulin sensitivity observed in CR vehicle mice. The metabolic differences between AL and CR vehicle mice were not accompanied by alterations in hypothalamic DRD2 binding. In conclusion, blocking DRD2 curtails the metabolic effects of calorie restriction. Although this suggests that the dopaminergic system could be involved in the metabolic benefits of calorie restriction, restricting access to high-fat food does not increase (hypothalamic) DRD2 binding capacity, which argues against this inference.", "first_author": "de Leeuw van Weenen, J E", "date_published": "2011 February"}, {"pmid": "20945430", "title": "Differential genetic susceptibility in diphasic and peak-dose dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.", "abstract": "To examine whether there is a differential genetic susceptibility in the diphasic and peak-dose forms of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

The differential role of these polymorphisms appears at early stages of treatment rather than in the final antidepressant outcome.

The etiology of cocaine addiction is complex and involves three types of factors: environmental factors, factors linked to the specific effects of cocaine and genetic factors. The latter could explain 40-60% of the risk for developing an addiction. Several studies have looked for a link between cocaine addiction and the genes of the dopaminergic system: the genes DRD2, COMT, SLC6A3 (coding for the dopamine transporter DAT) and DBH (coding for the dopamine beta hydroxylase) but unfortunately very few well established results. Pharmacogenetic approach could be an interesting opportunity for the future. The gene DBH has particularly been linked with the psychotic effects caused by cocaine. This so-called cocaine-induced psychosis (CIP) or cocaine-induced paranoia may influence the development of cocaine addiction. Indeed, these psychotic symptoms during cocaine exposure could cause an aversive effect limiting the development of an addiction. Several functional alterations caused by different mutations of the genes involved in dopaminergic transmission (principally-1021C>T of the gene DBH, but also Val158Met of the gene COMT, TaqI A of the gene DRD2 and VNTR 9 repeat of the DAT) could result in a cocaine-induced psychosis prone phenotype. We are hypothesising that the appearance of CIP during the first contact with cocaine is associated with a lower risk of developing cocaine addiction. This protective effect could be associated with the presence of one or more polymorphisms associated with CIP. A pharmacogenetic approach studying combination of polymorphism could isolate a sub-group of patients at risk for CIPs but more favorably protected from developing an addiction.

Beside antipsychotic drugs, other psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and lithium carbonate can cause this life threatening side-effect. Underlying mechanism of this side-effect is still unknown and debated. So far some risk factors have been identified, with clinical observations and recent pharmacogenetic research suggesting (with inconsistent findings) correlation between genetic mechanisms and predisposition to MNS. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 enzyme through which most psychotropic drugs are metabolized and TaqIA DRD2 which is target for antipsychotic drugs could be the link between pharmacogenetic factors and potential for development of MNS. In this paper we present two case reports with clinical presentation of three consecutive MNS. One patient developed MNS while he was taking combination of drugs: first time haloperidol, promazine and fluphenazine, second time fluphenazine and perazine and third time clozapine, promazine and valproic acid consecutively. The other patient developed MNS while taking following combination of drugs: first time haloperidol and lithium carbonate, second time risperidone and third time clozapine consecutively. Pharmacogenetic analysis for CYP2D6 and TaqI A DRD2 polymorphisms for both patients was done. Genotypisation of CYP2D6*1*3*4*5*6 in both patients showed no evidence of poor metabolizer phenotype. On the other hand, first patient was heterozygous for CYP2D6*4 (genotype *1/*4). CYP2D6 polymorphisms could have clinical significance because may lead to toxicity and unwanted side-effects in standard usual antipsychotic dose ranges. Analysis Taql A DRD2 polymorphism for first patient showed that he is heterozygous for A1 allele (genotype A1A2) which is commonly associated with predisposition to MNS. According to our literature three consecutive MNS are rarely described, and incidence of MNS generally is too low to perform clinical research. Many patophysiological mechanisms may probably underlie this complex and potentially fatal syndrome, still unknown etiology. But, genetic mechanisms could be significant. Further pharmacogenetic research, findings and analysis in patients who develop single or repeated MNS are strongly recommended.

Therefore, it seems plausible that variation in the DRD(2) gene is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. The authors conducted the first meta-analysis to examine the relationship between DRD2 polymorphisms and antipsychotic drug response. METHOD: A MEDLINE search of articles available up to December 31, 2008, yielded 18 prospective studies examining DRD2 gene variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia patients; of which, 10 independent studies met criteria for inclusion. Clinical response to antipsychotic treatment was defined as a 50% reduction of either the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at approximately 8 weeks of follow-up evaluation. Odds ratio was the primary effect-size measure and computed for each polymorphism in each study. Sufficient data were available for two DRD2 polymorphisms: -141C Ins/Del and Taq1A. RESULTS: Six studies reported results for the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism (total sample size: N=687). The Del allele carrier was significantly associated with poorer antipsychotic drug response relative to the Ins/Ins genotype. Eight studies assessed the Taq1A polymorphism and antipsychotic response (total sample size: N=748).

An individual's genetic information may eventually help diagnosis and treatment, as well selecting optimal pharmacologic agents based partly on how well they reach their target, how well they will bind to and produce an effect at their targets, how well they will be metabolized, and the profile of their adverse effects. It also appears that clinicians may be able to utilize an individual's genetic information to ascertain a subject's risk or susceptibility of developing a particular medical condition. Although, this has not been widely utilized in pain medicine at this point, the future may revolutionize the role of genetic information in the evaluation and management of various pain conditions. One reason for variations in therapeutic outcomes from different pharmacologic pain treatments is the different genetic disposition of patient to develop pain or to respond to analgesics. The patient's phenotype may represent a conglomerate of several different genetic variants concomitantly present in an individual. Genetic variants may modulate the risk of developing a painful condition, or may modulate the perception of pain (e.g. OPRM1 or GCH1 variants conferring modest \"protection\" from pain by increasing the tone of the endogenous opioid system or decreasing nitric oxide formation). Other genetic polymorphisms may alter pharmacokinetic mechanisms (e.g. CYP2D6 related prodrug activation of codeine to morphine), alter pharmacodynamic mechanisms (e.g. opioid receptor mutations), or alter other analgesic effects (e.g. diminished euphoric effects from opioids potentially due to DRD2 polymorphisms decreasing the functioning of the dopaminergic reward system).

Candidate genes involved in the pharmacokinetics (CYP2D6 and ABCB1) and pharmacodynamics (HTR2A, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, HTR6) of the drug, and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, were analysed.

While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed \"supersensitivity\" might be tied to genetic dopaminergic polymorphisms. Another therapeutic conundrum relates to the paradoxical finding that the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine induces stronger activation of brain reward circuitry in individuals who carry the DRD2 A1 allele compared with DRD2 A2 allele carriers. Because carriers of the A1 allele relative to the A2 allele of the DRD2 gene have significantly lower D2 receptor density, a reduced sensitivity to dopamine agonist activity would be expected in the former. Thus, it is perplexing that with low D2 density there is an increase in reward sensitivity with the dopamine D2 agonist bromocriptine. Moreover, under chronic or long-term therapy with D2 agonists, such as bromocriptine, it has been shown in vitro that there is a proliferation of D2 receptors. One explanation for this relates to the demonstration that the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with increased striatal activity of L-amino acid decarboxylase, the final step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. This appears to be a protective mechanism against low receptor density and would favor the utilization of an amino acid neurotransmitter precursor like L-tyrosine for preferential synthesis of dopamine. This seems to lead to receptor proliferation to normal levels and results in significantly better treatment compliance only in A1 carriers. PROPOSAL AND CONCLUSION: We propose that low D2 receptor density and polymorphisms of the D2 gene are associated with risk for relapse of substance abuse, including alcohol dependence, heroin craving, cocaine dependence, methamphetamine abuse, nicotine sensitization, and glucose craving. With this in mind, we suggest a putative physiological mechanism that may help to explain the enhanced sensitivity following intense acute dopaminergic D2 receptor activation: \"denervation supersensitivity.\" Rats with unilateral depletions of neostriatal dopamine display increased sensitivity to dopamine agonists estimated to be 30 to 100 x in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rotational model. Given that mild striatal dopamine D2 receptor proliferation occurs (20%-40%), it is difficult to explain the extent of behavioral supersensitivity by a simple increase in receptor density. Thus, the administration of dopamine D2 agonists would target D2 sensitization and attenuate relapse, especially in D2 receptor A1 allele carriers. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by clinical trials utilizing amino acid neurotransmitter precursors, enkephalinase, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme inhibition, which have resulted in attenuated relapse rates in reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) probands. If future translational research reveals that dopamine agonist therapy reduces relapse in RDS, it would support the proposed concept, which we term \"deprivation-amplification relapse therapy\" (DART). This term couples the mechanism for relapse, which is \"deprivation-amplification,\" especially in DRD2 A1 allele carriers with natural D2 agonist therapy utilizing amino acid precursors and COMT and enkepalinase inhibition therapy.", "first_author": "Blum, Kenneth", "date_published": "2009 November"}, {"pmid": "19929252", "title": "Pharmacogenetics of D2 dopamine receptor gene in prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Dopamine-agonists are the treatment of choice of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (PRL-omas).

METHODS: Thirty patients with PD prospectively received pramipexole 0.25 mg three times daily for 2 months. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessments were conducted at baseline and 2 months after treatment initiation. Improvement by 20% or more in the total score on the UPDRS was considered to indicate responsiveness. The PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to analyze the DRD2 Taq1A and DRD3 Ser9Gly genotype. RESULTS: The DRD2 Taq1A allele frequencies were A141.7 (A1) and 58.3% (A2), and the DRD3 Ser9Gly allele frequencies were 68.3 (Ser) and 31.7% (Gly). When the subjects were grouped by the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism, the response rates for pramipexole treatment were significantly higher in the Ser/Ser group (60%) than in the group containing the Gly allele (13%).

One potential moderating factor is variation in brain DA activity, which is influenced by dopamine-related genes: the DA transporter (DAT) (SLC6A3), the DA D2 receptor (DRD2), and the DA D4 receptor (DRD4) genes. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between dopamine-related gene polymorphisms and food consumption in ADHD children receiving varying doses of MPH.

Observations of percent lunch consumed as a function of dopamine-related genotypes and MPH dose were analyzed using mixed effects regression models. RESULTS: A significant dose-response reduction in eating was observed across all genotypes (p < 0.001). There was an interaction of DAT SLC6A3 and DRD2 genotypes and dose, because 9/9 DAT children showed a stronger effect of dose when compared with the 9/10 and 10/10 children (p < 0.001) and DRD2 A2/A2 children showed a stronger effect of dose when compared with A1/A1 and A1/A2 children combined (p = 0.007).

METHODS: Medically healthy 7 to 17-year-old patients chronically treated with risperidone but receiving no other antipsychotics were recruited in a cross-sectional study. Four DRD2 variants were genotyped and prolactin concentration was measured. Medication history was obtained from the medical records. The effect of the TaqIA variants of the DRD2 on the risk of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 50% of 107 patients (87% males) treated with risperidone for an average of 2.9 years. Age, stage of sexual development, and the dose of risperidone independently predicted a higher prolactin concentration, whereas the dose of psychostimulants was negatively correlated with it. However, these four predictors became nonsignificant when risperidone serum concentration was entered into the model. Adverse events potentially related to hyperprolactinemia were more common in participants with elevated prolactin concentration and in girls (45%) compared with boys (10%).

The aim of this study was to detect the presence of gene GCH-I mutation in our population in patients with dopa-responsive dystonic dyskinesia and to analyse clinical specificity of the affected. METHODS: Out of the group of patients with dystonia of different distribution four patients were separated whose clinical picture indicated the diagnosis of DRD. Two patients had a positive family anamnesis while the other two were sporadic. Genetic analysis was performed by the use of a standard protocol, which included PCR amplification and DNK sequencing according to the method of Senger and autoradiografy. RESULTS: In the patients from the family DRD-1 new hetaerazygote point mutation 520G-->A in 4-m exson gene GCH-I was revealed. First symptoms of the disease showed in the age of seven by the torsion of the left foot, progressively advanced and got into the evolution of numbness in the legs, aggravated gait, tending to worsen in the evening, and the therapy with levodopa (500 mg) produced a dramatic effect. The second mutation in the female patient from the family DRD-2 was homozygote deletion in 1-m intron gene GCH-I (IVS1-85delA). Unwilling torsion of the foot, feeling of weakness in the lower extremities (that caused falling without loss of the consciousness) were clinical demonstrations of the disease. The application of levodopa (300 mg) caused regression of the symptoms of the disease. Hetaerazygote deletion of adenine in the position 209 in the first exon (209del A) was identificated in the patient DRD-3 with negative family anamnesis, in who in the age of ten the torsion of the foot inside occured for the first time following by trembling of both the left and right legs at rest; after a few years, tremor of hands also appeared, which became worse in stressful situations. The father of the patient was an asymptomatic bearer of mutation. The fourth mutation in gene GCH-I was found in I exon gene GCH-I, 208delA. The disease was started by torsion of the left foot, progressing easily, and worsening in the evenings, but at the age of 30, moving became harder, fatigue and pain in muscles, increased and at the age of 40 the patient recognised the change of speech.

RESULTS: Significant results were observed for weight loss, sugar craving reduction, appetite suppression, snack reduction, reduction of late night eating (all P<0.01), increased perception of overeating, enhanced quality of sleep, increased happiness (all P<0.05), and increased energy (P<0.001). Polymorphic correlates were obtained for a number of genes (LEP, PPAR-gamma2, MTHFR, 5-HT2A, and DRD2 genes) with positive clinical parameters tested in this study. Of all the outcomes and gene polymorphisms, only the DRD2 gene polymorphism (A1 allele) had a significant Pearson correlation with days on treatment (r=0.42, P=0.045).

Additionally, variants in the transcribed region, termed here 'structural RNA SNPs' (srSNPs), can affect mRNA processing and turnover. Both rSNPs and srSNPs cause allelic mRNA expression imbalance (AEI) in heterozygous individuals. We have used AEI to discover and characterize regulatory polymorphisms in OPRM1, TPH2, MDR1, DRD2, and VKORC1. The objective of this study was to use AEI to determine the extent of cis-regulatory factors in pharmacogenetic genes. METHODS: We applied a rapid and accurate AEI methodology for testing 42 genes implicated in cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases, and affecting drug metabolism and transport. Each gene was analyzed in physiologically relevant human autopsy tissues, including brain, heart, liver, intestines, and lymphocytes. RESULTS: Substantial AEI was observed in approximately 55% of the surveyed genes. Focusing on cardiovascular candidate genes in human hearts, AEI analysis revealed frequent cis-acting regulatory factors in ACE and SOD2 mRNA expression, having potential clinical significance. SNP scanning to locate regulatory polymorphisms in a number of genes failed to support several previously proposed promoter SNPs discovered with use of reporter gene assays in heterologous tissues, while srSNPs appear more frequent than expected. Computational analysis of mRNA folding indicates that approximately 90% of srSNPs affect mRNA folding, and hence potentially function.

There are polymorphic variations of this gene (DRD(2)), but it is not clear that they have clinical relevance in predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or antipsychotic response.

As genetic heterogeneity in drug targets can influence drug response, we sought to further evaluate the contribution of CYP2D6 to pharmacodynamic sensitivity in our previous study sample in tandem with DRD2, the primary molecular target for perphenazine. METHODS: Genotyping for DRD2 Taq1A, -141C ins/del and Ser311Cys functional polymorphisms was performed using PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism methods. RESULTS: After controlling for DRD2 polymorphisms, CYP2D6 was a significant predictor of pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity to perphenazine (P=0.024; power=80.4%). Taq1A polymorphism significantly influenced the time course of prolactin response (P=0.039; power=70%).

The A1 allele of the Taq1A polymorphism was previously shown to decrease D2 receptor density in vitro and in neuroimaging studies in vivo.

In 1996, we coined the term Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS). Past and current treatment of substance seeking behavior, a subtype of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS), is considered by most to be inadequate. Recently, we evaluated a complex named Synaptamine [Haveos (SG8839R)]. The main difference with an older studied variant and the latest variant is the inclusion of a proprietary form of Rhodiola rosea, a known catechol-O-methyl-transferase inhibitor (COMT) to potentially enhance the activity of presynaptic released dopamine. In this regard, based on the current literature we hypothesize that manipulation of catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) activity to influence the attenuation of substance seeking behavior, is dependent upon gene polymorphisms. In this regard we hypothesize that carrying the LL genotype with low COMT activity should as theorized, increase the reward induced by substance-induced dopamine release and may indeed increase the propensity to type 1 alcoholism and possibly other drugs that activate the dopaminergic system. Thus when alcohol is present in low COMT LL genotype, increasing COMT activity, not inhibiting it should assist in the reduction of social consumption or abuse. Alternatively, under physiological conditions (no psychoactive substances present (e.g. alcohol) carrying the DRD2 A1 allele with associated low D2 receptors should, as theorized, increase craving behavior because of a low or hypodopaminergic state causing the individual to seek out substances that increase the release of dopamine for subsequent activation of unbound D2 sites in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, in the absence of alcohol or other psychoactive drugs (dopamine releasers), especially during recovery or rehabilitation, decreasing, not increasing COMT activity, should result in enhanced synaptic dopamine as physiologically released, thereby proliferating D2 receptors while reducing stress, increasing well-being, reducing craving behavior and preventing relapse. Based on this hypothesis, we believe that adding the COMT inhibitor R. rosea (as Rhodimin) to our amino-acid and chromium combination in DUI offenders and other illegal drug-related crimes, increases the potential for more targeted neurochemical rebalancing and enhanced relapse prevention. Finally, we hypothesize that these data coupled together provide evidence that the combination of enkephalinase inhibition, neurotransmitter precursor loading, brain tryptophan enhancing and COMT inhibition as well as DNA analysis of the individual's genome, may be useful as an adjunct to therapy when used in outpatient recovery, specifically to assist in reducing craving behavior and preventing relapse.", "first_author": "Blum, Kenneth", "date_published": "2007"}, {"pmid": "17455212", "title": "Polymorphisms in dopamine receptor DRD1 and DRD2 genes and psychopathological and extrapyramidal symptoms in patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment.", "abstract": "DRD(1) and DRD(2) receptor gene variants have been associated with clinical aspects of schizophrenia; however only specific features were analyzed in different samples.

METHODS: All spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports received by the Swedish Medical Products Agency until December 1999 that were coded with EPS and judged to be at least possibly related to SSRI treatment were included in the study. Reporting physicians received a form for collection of relevant information including current and previous use of SSRIs and antipsychotics, alcohol or substance abuse, central nervous system damage, a history of epilepsy or EPS, and a family history of Parkinson disease. A blood sample was also requested for genotyping of selected cytochrome P-450, and serotonin and dopamine transporter and receptor mutations. RESULTS: A total of 64 cases of EPS were reported.

The present study extends prior pharmacogenetic investigations of the D(2) receptor gene (DRD2) by examining, in first-episode schizophrenia patients, promoter region variation as a predictor of response time to two first-line atypical antipsychotics. METHOD: Patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (N=61) were genotyped for two DRD2 promoter region polymorphisms (A-241G and -141C Ins/Del) and were randomly assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine.

There are several likely reasons for this failure, ranging from poor study design with low statistical power to genetic mechanisms such as polygenic inheritance, epigenetic interactions, and pleiotropy. Most study designs currently in use are inadequate to uncover these mechanisms. However, to date, genetic studies have provided some valuable insight into the causes and potential therapies for psychiatric disorders. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the understanding of the genetic etiology of psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, will be more successful with integrative approaches considering both genetic and epigenetic factors. For example, several genes including those encoding dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia and related disorders through meta-analyses and large, multicenter studies. There is also growing evidence for the role of DRD1, NMDA receptor genes (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent studies have indicated that epigenetic modification of reelin (RELN), BDNF, and the DRD2 promoters confer susceptibility to clinical psychiatric conditions. Pharmacologic therapy of psychiatric disorders will likely be more effective once the molecular pathogenesis is known. For example, the hypoactive alleles of DRD2 and the hyperactive alleles of COMT, which degrade the dopamine in the synaptic cleft, are associated with schizophrenia. It is likely that insufficient dopaminergic transmission in the frontal lobe plays a role in the development of negative symptoms associated with this disorder. Antipsychotic therapies with a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist effect may be a plausible alternative to current therapies, and would be effective in symptom reduction in psychotic individuals. It is also possible that therapies employing dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonists or COMT inhibitors will be beneficial for patients with negative symptoms in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

SETTING: Referral center for Parkinson disease in Calabria, southern Italy. Patients Two hundred fifty patients with Parkinson disease were screened for the presence or absence of PDD following a short-term levodopa administration, and 215 subjects were available for further evaluations, including genotypic analysis of the CA dinucleotide short tandem repeat (CAn-STR) polymorphism located in the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2). RESULTS: One hundred five patients (48.8%) exhibited PDD following short-term levodopa administration, and 110 patients (51.2%) did not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that independent predictors for the occurrence of PDD were female sex, earlier age at onset of Parkinson disease, longer duration of treatment, and higher dose of levodopa. Genetic factors related to the DRD2 CAn-STR polymorphism were not independent predictors for PDD in the total population, but they had a strong protective effect on the appearance of PDD when the multivariate analysis was performed in men (odds ratio, 0.34 [95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.84]).

I propose that dopamine receptor (DR) downregulation could be an alternative strategy to compromise dopaminergic overactivity implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Agonist-induced receptor downregulation includes receptor proteolysis, modulation of receptor gene transcription and affecting of RNA stability. These processes cause a decrease of existing receptors and reduction of receptor synthesis.

Of those who had no comorbid substance abuse, 44.1% carried the D2A1 allele, compared to 60.5% of those who had comorbid substance abuse. Forty-eight controls and 102 gamblers completed a shorter version of the Pathological Gambling Score. Of the 45 controls with a score of zero, 17.8% carried the D2A1 allele. Of the 99 gamblers with a score of 5 or more, 52.5% carried the D2A1 allele (chi 2 = 15.36, p = 0.00009). These results suggest that genetic variants at the DRD2 gene play a role in pathological gambling, and support the concept that variants of this gene are a risk factor for impulsive and addictive behaviours.", "first_author": "Comings, D E", "date_published": "1996 June"}, {"pmid": "8845863", "title": "The dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene: a genetic risk factor in smoking.", "abstract": "Of a group of 312 non-Hispanic Caucasians who smoked at least one pack per day, had unsuccessfully attempted to stop smoking, and were free of alcohol or other drug dependence, 48.7% carried the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene. This was significantly greater than the 25.9% prevalence in the 714 known non-Hispanic Caucasian controls without alcohol or drug abuse, p < 10(-8), and significantly greater than in a smaller set of our study controls. There was a significant, inverse relationship between the prevalence of the D2A1 allele and the age of onset of smoking, p = 0.02, and the maximum duration of time the smokers had been able to quit smoking on their own, p = 0.02.

Dopaminergic reward pathways have frequently been implicated in the etiology of addictive behaviour. While other neurotransmitters have also been implicated, to date the only molecular genetic defect which has been found to associate with alcoholism, drug dependency, obesity, smoking, pathological gambling, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, as well as other related compulsive behaviours, are the variants of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2). In this review of the available data on the subject, we report a number of independent meta-analyses that confirm an association of DRD2 polymorphisms and impulsive-additive-compulsive behaviour (IACB), which we have termed \"Reward Deficiency Syndrome\". While we agree that Meta-analyses of all exant studies support an association of variants of DRD2 and IACB, correct negative findings with alcoholism may be due to differences in assessing controls and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selection of diseased probands.", "first_author": "Blum, K", "date_published": "1995 June"}, {"pmid": "7585063", "title": "Bromocriptine in the treatment of alcoholics with the D2 dopamine receptor A1 allele.", "abstract": "Various types of alcoholics have been described and heredity has been shown to be involved in some of these types. An important role of the mesolimbic dopamine system has been suggested in the reinforcing effects of alcohol and recent molecular genetic studies are implicating the gene for the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) in alcoholism. In a double-blind study, bromocriptine, a DRD2 agonist, or placebo was administered to alcoholics with either the A1 (A1/A1 and A1/A2 genotypes) or only the A2 (A2/A2 genotype) allele of the DRD2 gene. The greatest improvement in craving and anxiety occurred in the bromocriptine-treated A1 alcoholics and attrition was highest in the placebo-treated A1 alcoholics.

In the present investigation, 155 Caucasian male and female diagnosed neuropsychiatrically-ill patients with and without comorbid drug and alcohol abuse/dependence were genotyped for the presence or absence of the A1 allele of the D2 dopamine receptor gene (DRD2). The relationship of the A1 and A2 alleles to P3 amplitude and latency was also determined. The results showed no significant difference in P3 amplitude between all groups studied with A1 and A2 allele carriers. However, we now report prolonged P3 latency in neuropsychiatrically-ill patients (with or without polysubstance abuse) with those carrying two copies of the A1 allele (homozygote) of the DRD2 gene (quadratic trend, p = 0.01). Moreover, the age-adjusted mean P3 latency in the D2A2/A2 allele group was 327.8 +/- 3.08 ms compared by ANOVA, to 360.04 +/- 4.86 ms in the D2A1/A1 group.
