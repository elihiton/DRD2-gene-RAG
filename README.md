# DRD2-gene-RAG
### Eli Hiton

## Introduction
Through the work of the Human Genome Project and research since then, we have access to a bounty of genetics research. Unfortunately, this research is spread across numerous databases and research papers. For a doctor wanting a quick question answered to a pharmaceutical researcher looking for a broad survey of a topic, sifting through this research might not be feasible. This project demonstrates the use of the RAG technique to answer questions about the DRD2 gene.
